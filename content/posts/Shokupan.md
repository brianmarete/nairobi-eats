📍Shokupan

Gonna start with my lovely experience at Shokupan today😊 It’s a cute little Japanese bakery in Sarit centre that I’ve been wanting to try. The menu was overwhelming because it’s quite long but everything looked good!

Tried a little bit of everything. Had the black sesame latte, the tiramisu pancakes🤤, some mushroom & tofu gyoza, firecracker cauliflower bao buns & a strawberry shortcake.

Loved everything. My fave were the pancakes and the bao buns & that cake😍

The restaurant is vegetarian and is a sister company to Barista & Co. They have amazing service and it’s actually in a corner of Sarit that isn’t so congested wauu🙊

Food prices range from 600/-1500/, & drinks 300/-500/

I’ll be dropping a review every Thursday (when possible) so stay tuned😊
