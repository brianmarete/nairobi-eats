The sun last week was so glorious, it prompted me to step out for lunch at Mezza. They are located at the new shopping complex on Rose Avenue, Kilimani, right at the top giving it a perfect rooftop vibe for a sunny day.

Mezza is known for its shawarmas and that’s really what I wanted to try but when I saw the menu and saw how juicy the burger was looking…. I went the burger route instead. I got the cheese burger with fries (KSH850/) and a strawberry lemonade (KSH300/) and my friend got the chicken shawarma so that I could still taste some of it.

I loved the shawarma! That chicken has been seasoned so well and it’s infused with their very yummy signature aioli sauce, lettuce, onions, tomatoes, all the works. They have a combo that comes with fries and a soda for KSH700/.

My only critique about the shawarma is the size, it’s quite small so getting only the shawarma is more of a snack than a meal, I wish the portions were slightly bigger. The burger wasn’t the best choice. It looked great, it was a good size, but the patty had some spice that I couldn’t pinpoint and was really affecting the entire burger experience. I don’t know if it was cinnamon or nutmeg, whatever it was… It was quite strong and you don’t typically expect a sweetness in a burger patty so that threw me off. The fries were absolutely perfect though.

We also tried the hummus and pita bread - can never go wrong with this combo, this was also good, I wanted more pita bread because I love bread too much. They have a wide menu including breakfast, the service was great and I for sure will go back to try their other options.
