Hashmi’s is a staple in the Kenyan food industry scene having been around since the mid 1990s up until now. Y’all remember they shut down for a while and we thought it was forever and went there in droves only to have it open back up in a different building a few months later? That was smart marketing targeting customer loyalty.

Hashmi’s BBQ is now located at Broadwalk Mall in Parklands and this is their biggest branch yet within Nairobi. They now have locations in Dubai and Mombasa as well.

They are most popular for their Indian bbq cuisine which is possibly some of the best Indian bbq I’ve had in this city, they stay undefeated no matter how many times they rebrand and I love it for them.

I came here on a Sunday for dinner with friends and it was very packed as it always is. I couldn’t take any videos because of that. It being such a spacious location, it may get full but your wait time won’t be too long especially if you go early, say around 6pm. It’s first come first serve, they don’t take any reservations.

They have a traditional seating style, big tables across the establishment, perfect for family style dining. You’re seated very quickly upon arrival (again depending on the time you show up) and your orders are taken just as quickly. We had an array of dishes i.e. chicken tikka (KSH1300), paneer tikka (KSH1300), fish tikka (KSH1500), mixed grill (KSH1950), chips masala (KSH400), butter naan (KSH200) and the kulfi milkshake (KSH500).

I really wanted their famous tangerine juice but it was sold out that day. If you’ve had this juice then you feel my pain, if you haven’t - please try it when you visit, it’s so good! The Kulfi milkshake is very rich in spices and quite a thick milkshake - if you’re okay with rich flavours and spices in a milkshake then you’ll enjoy this one.

My go-to dish here every time since my first visit back in 2010 has always been the chicken tikka (leg), some fresh naan, some masala chips and tangerine juice. It’s been my standard order for years and has never failed me. That chicken tikka is barbecued to perfection, it’s moist yet charred, full of flavour and the perfect size. The butter naan is so soft to the touch and taste, bread will forever be my downfall I fear…

The fish tikka is a hit or miss sometimes. This time it was a miss - wasn’t as spicy (quite mild), the last time i had it i loved it, this time… just okay.

The paneer tikka was a first for me to try this time and I loved it! You’d think a few cubes of paneer like that won’t fill you up but you forget that paneer is literally blocks of cheese. That and some chips masala na kafaluda, you won’t want to eat again for a while. For all the lactose intolerant people please don’t try this combo unless you have your pills or you have close proximity to a bathroom thanks

The star of the show on this day though was the mixed grill - also something new I had never tried off their menu. It’s a mix of grilled chicken, mutton, beef and lamb chops, a little bit of everything for those who love their meat and don’t want to stick to just one thing. Delicious! That lamb especially - so so good

The service here was good, a little too good actually Because it’s such a busy restaurant, their service flow is round the clock where the waiters take your order, they bring your order after around 15-20min, they go serve other tables, they come back to check if anyone’s done, they clear any plate that’s seemingly empty, they pack any doggy bags, they disappear for 5min, they come back with the bill… like no question as to whether we’re done or if we want something else. Then they hover… just waiting. Waiting to see that the bill gets paid, once it’s paid, they start to wipe the table and clear everything from it… felt like we were subliminally being told ‘okay times up… we need the table now’ Like zero downtime for us to chat, let food settle… she just hovered.

And as soon as we stood up to leave, I saw the manager usher in a new group ready to take our place immediately. Wueh! I guess yes to efficient service flow and making sure customers aren’t waiting forever but the constant hovering was uncomfortable and I feel like they should allow people time to sit and enjoy the place because if you’re out as a group for lunch/dinner, it’s not something that should be rushed.

That being said, it’s not going to stop me from coming back because the food here is too good to dismiss it and Hashmi’s delivery just doesn’t hit the same as when it’s fresh off the grill right there in the restaurant.

I wouldn’t recommend this place for a date because will you even be given time to share your favourite colour kabla waanze kuclear meza?? Unless you don’t mind that rush or maybe come on a weekday when it’s not too busy. It’s perfect for family/friend group/work group lunches or dinners. Great for birthdays or any other celebration that’s not too intimate and it’s affordable too.

May it stand the test of time like the likes of Burger Hut and Trattoria and remain a major icon in the restaurant industry in Kenya for decades to come.
