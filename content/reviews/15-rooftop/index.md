I’ve been here a few times, & the fact that I keep going back means I must like it. I really love their lemon pasta! I’m not usually a pasta person but this particular dish - I’m happy to have it over & over again. I added prawns to it because why not.

My friend had grilled salmon, accompanied with baby potatoes and some vegetables. We also tried the fried chicken bites for starters and their truffle fries that are quite addictive (but also cost 400/ so… order it one time unless your money is long lol)

My other friend and fellow foodie [Jaytakeapic](https://www.instagram.com/jaytakeapic/) mentioned their buttermilk chicken one time and I immediately had to try it, and let me tell you something… That dish is the bee's knees! So so good!

My experiences here have always been great, the sunset views of the park are stunning. They have a bigger space above the main restaurant which can be used for events, big groups etc, the sound coverage in this room is quite poor though, they need to install more speakers to give off a better surround sound.
