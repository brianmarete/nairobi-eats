It’s quite a hidden gem, literally lol, tucked away on Lenana Rd, follow the Google maps diligently or you’ll miss the turning like I did. I had a dinner plan with a friend and we decided to try this place thanks to all the good things I’ve heard from many people.

Got here around 7pm and was surprised to find it very empty on a Saturday evening. I figured maybe people would come there later…nope, nobody came. It’s a really cute place though! Love the chill, clean, airy vibes it has and since it’s quite small you’re better off making reservations to book a table inside or outside.

I was very excited to immediately try their popular fish tacos but I was told the Kez Organics range of salsas that go with their tacos had run out so we ended up getting the bbq chicken thigh taco (KSH1000) & the honey & soy panko wings (KSH1300). So the bbq chicken taco is massive! The food portions are definitely on point and the fries are so yummy. BUT… I was expecting chicken doused in bbq sauce - I barely tasted any sauce. I had my friend taste it too, his sentiments were the same.

I asked the chef and he said he cooked the chicken in bbq sauce but I guess it didn’t hold as well? The taco was good, just not as great as I thought it would be for a bbq chicken taco. The wings though?? Perfect! Big, juicy, covered in sauce and so much flavour.

Seeing as we were the only people there I can’t say that the service lacked. I definitely would like to come back and try the fish taco and more of their wings but for my first time - this wasn’t a bad experience.
