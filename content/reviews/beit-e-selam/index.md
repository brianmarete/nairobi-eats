I had heard such mixed reviews of this restaurant but I still went ahead to try it & it’s quickly become a place I love so much! Beautiful beautiful place. It’s not outfitted to be Instagram worthy with too many aesthetics, but it still gives off an almost exotic ambience, it really feels like you’re in a whole different place when you enter there. It has elements of Swahili/Arab theme decor and the courtyard is so softly lit giving cosy vibes. I highly recommend this for a date night location.

They have quite a limited but well crafted menu. I had the coffee popcorn as a starter and the corn ribs as well. The popcorn was really good esp because there’s a sprinkling of cayenne in there which kicks in once you eat said popcorn, love that.

The corn ribs you guys… it’s sweet corn but I don’t know what oils/sauce they slather over those things because they were delicious! A must have every time I visit. For the mains - we had the Moroccan lamb burger. It’s so juicy, so yummy, and it’s topped with a slab of feta and onions and had a sauce that I need to learn how to make ASAP.

Prices range from KSH600-800 for starters and KSH1300-3000 for mains and desserts were around KSH800/900. I had the flourless chocolate cake for dessert given as a recommendation but I didn’t like it much, it was just okay.

Service: our waiter wasn’t on it… he kept forgetting our orders and would disappear for long periods of time, the manager had to take over our table at some point. That little tidbit above didn’t ruin my experience though, I enjoyed being there, loved the look and feel of the place, enjoyed the music and it’s a place that’s perfect for intimate dinners as well as big parties as well.

They require reservations, no walk-ins allowed (though I don’t know if this is still a thing) and it gets quite busy in the evenings and on weekends.

Also - don’t drive there, there is barely any parking.
