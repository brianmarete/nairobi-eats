Formerly where Nyama Mama used to be at Delta Towers, Westlands, the 254 Beer District is a nice take on a bar, restaurant and event space all in one. It has a great open layout that makes the indoors feel like you’re outside and the outdoors feel like you’re inside. The decor is very industrial and edgy, a mix of high and low tables, cool murals, exposed pipes and you can’t miss floating plants in a place like this to bring some warmth to the edginess.

The menu is so inviting with their array of southern style dishes, lots of burgers, lots of barbecue, think bar food with a twist. I was starving on this particular day so opted to get a smokehouse burger (KSH1450/) which comes with fries and a side of slaw. My friends had the Buffalo kuku-pops (KSH1050/) and the BBQ beef burrito (KSH1250/).

That burger was massive! I wasn’t complaining believe me - the hunger I was feeling that day, I’d have eaten two of them if I had the room. It’s a double patty with bacon and cheddar cheese and bbq sauce, nice and simple, just how I like it. That was a good burger. I can’t say the patty was super flavourful but it did what it needed to do i.e. fill me up. That slaw though?? That coleslaw was so good! Next time I’ll need more of that and less of the fries.

The kuku-pops were way too oily and I’m also not the biggest fan of buffalo sauce so I wasn't particularly impressed by that dish. The burrito was nice and big but a tad dry. I couldn’t taste any BBQ in that beef at all. For those who love guacamole, that really helps the burrito come together taste wise.

Being a tap room, they craft their own beers and have quite a variety here and the beers are also sold in stores - I can’t speak on these as I don’t drink but if you’ve tried any of their beers, feel free to let us know your thoughts in the comment section below🍻

We were here for one of the [Nakili Sessions](https://twitter.com/nakili_sessions) that takes place every Tuesday from 6pm. This particular one featured [Dela](https://www.instagram.com/delathedelz/) and it was such a great time! I appreciate these intimate live music sessions because it really lets you listen, vibe and appreciate the artist’s music in a space that isn’t overpowered by people & outside chaos. Music, good food, drinks and your people to vibe with… what’s a better plan than that? These events get filled up pretty quick so if you see your fave is performing soon - make a reservation to make sure you have a front row seat!

254 Beer District has daily happy hours and more events on the weekends and I like that it’s a space for more than just eating and drinking. Perfect for a weekday catchup after work or a hangout with friends over the weekend.
