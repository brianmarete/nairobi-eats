Shokupan is a cute little Japanese bakery in Sarit centre that I’ve been wanting to try. The menu was overwhelming because it’s quite long but everything looked so good! I tried a little bit of everything. I had the black sesame latte, the tiramisu pancakes, some mushroom & tofu gyoza, firecracker cauliflower bao buns & a strawberry shortcake.

I loved everything. My favourites were the pancakes and the bao buns & that cake! The restaurant is vegetarian and is a sister company to Barista & Co. They have amazing service and it’s actually in a corner of Sarit that isn’t so congested yay:) Food prices range from KSH600/ - KSH1500/, & drinks KSH300/ - KSH500/.
