I finally got to try the famous Uncle Nene’s burgers and I went all the way to their Garden Estate branch to get the full experience! For those who haven’t been and don’t live near that area, just be prepared for quite a drive.

The restaurant is quite quaint, not too much pizazz, nice and simple. Perfect for a casual lunch or dinner plan. I came here for lunch with a friend a while back. The menu is also very simple, burgers, fries, loaded fries and drinks and that’s it. We got the beef bacon cheese burger which is accompanied with their signature fries (KSH1000).

Everything so far had been okay up until we had to wait longer than usual for a simple meal of a burger and fries… over 40 minutes wait time for a meal at a fast food joint is actually wild. And truly bad for business because I had already mentally said how I would never be coming back or ordering from them again.

The food eventually got to us and my energy was so shot because of hunger so I really scoffed that food down Long wait aside - I gotta say the burger was really good. Very fresh and full flavour, the bread didn’t disintegrate at first bite and that beef, bacon & cheese combo will hit the spot every time. I see why their fries are their signature - perfectly seasoned, perfectly salted and that crinkle cut is a fun look for any potato. I could eat those fries in a heartbeat if they were in front of me right now.

I enjoyed the food here thoroughly! Not enough to come back though… They’ve lost me as a dine-in customer. After some time had passed and I healed from that period, I decided to try their pick-up spot in Ngumo on my way home from work. I called, made my order and they said it would be ready in 30… I left the office and got there in that 30min and true to form, the food was ready - okay Uncle Nene’s There they redeemed themselves and the packaging was great in that nothing got mushy or messy and I ate the burger straight out of the box once I got home.

So it seems like their dine-in just has super slow service. For those willing to sit there and wait, then that would work for you. For the rest of us who would rather not wait, I think their pick up point or delivery option works better.
