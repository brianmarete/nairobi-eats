Today’s review is about a place that pleasantly surprised me. It’s located along the Westfield Hub strip mall along Likoni road, Kilimani. My friend introduced me to this place on a day when I was so starved! I was ready to eat anything and he was like - let’s get Jollof! It's quite small so not really a place to dine in but perfect for takeaway.

We got the Jollof lunchbox (KSH850), they had a BOGOF offer so one was chicken and the other had beef. We also got some fried plantains (KSH250). So - disclaimer, I’ve never had Nigerian jollof before, so I can’t speak on the authenticity of this one, I’ve only ever tried the Ghanaian one. This jollof though was BANGING. It was so good.

The flavours, the spices, the sauce… all of that married together with the perfectly grilled chicken and a touch of sweetness from the plantain… I inhaled that whole dish and was very satisfied. The lunchbox comes with coleslaw, and some plantain as well within the box which we didn’t know so the extra pack we got was a nice bonus. I’m generally not a fan of plantains (don’t kill me please) and I wasn’t going to have any but since the food was spicy, decided to try some and see if it helps balance out the heat and it really did. I love a sweet & spicy combo anyday. Maybe jollof is what I needed to get me to start eating plantains.

So now that I’ve had both Nigerian & Ghanaian jollof (in Kenya lol) I can safely say - Nigerian Jollof is better… so much better. If I’m ever in either of the two countries - I’ll try the jollof there as well and come report back:)
