We are in Ocho Rios today🇯🇲 Miss T’s Kitchen came highly recommended from the internets so I was excited to finally try it out. It’s such a vibrant place with so much colour and a little playground right at the entrance😊

The hostess we met at the door wasn’t in the best mood though, not sure why… she barely wanted to seat us yet the place was quite empty for a Sunday evening. If you’re a host/hostess, you need to have a better attitude to avoid sullying the experience of the patron, especially since you’re the 1st person the customer meets.

Luckily for us, the servers were much better so it didn’t spoil the experience. The menu was filled with many Jamaican favourites plus your usual pastas, salads etc. They did not have a drinks menu which I found odd given they have a bar…🤔 Anyway, our orders included jerk chicken with rice and peas (of course lol, $20), brown stew chicken with rice and peas ($22), coconut shrimp curry ($27) and a side of plantain ($2).

This jerk chicken was just okay… amazing, not so much but still moist and flavourful👌🏾 That brown stew chicken though?? Delicious🤤 That stew slapped! So rich, so thick and the chicken had clearly been simmering in it for a minute because those flavours were perfect.

The best thing here though was that curried shrimp… it would never be my first choice but I’m glad my friend ordered it because I can now say I’ve tasted some of the best coconut shrimp curry in my life. They don’t put in as much shrimp in the curry but the portion given was still very filling. So delicious, so much flavour, that curry was the star of the whole dinner!

I found it odd that they had small servings of potato salad on every dish, like how you can add a small salad to every dish, here they put a dollop of potato salad on every dish. Also started to note that everywhere we went, the plantain servings were so small, and for $2… I’m gonna need more than five slices of plantain please. For a country that has so much plantain it’s surprising that they serve so little of it at restaurants.

For drinks - my friend had a mango daiquiri, it was filled with lots of rum, but not as blended as it should be but according to her, it was really good.

Miss T’s Kitchen overall was a good experience and a must visit for those looking to try some good old fashioned Jamaican cooking👌🏾
