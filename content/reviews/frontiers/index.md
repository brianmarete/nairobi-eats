We’re in Nanyuki today! Talking about Frontiers coffee bar and restaurant located at One Stop, Nanyuki town. It’s a beautiful outdoor space and nice reprieve after a long drive coming into Nanyuki from Nairobi.

I came here for lunch with some friends on a Sunday and we didn’t have trouble finding seating despite being a large group. They have plenty of outdoor seating space under the hot Nanyuki sun which was very welcome coming from freezing Nairobi.

The menu covers a bit of everything, and here’s what I tried - feta & coriander samosas (KSH600), cheese burger (KSH1100), Richard’s burger (KSH1200) and the meat feast pizza (KSH1200). The feta samosas were actually really good, perfect starters especially if you’re starving like I was that day.

I tend to order a burger on my first visit to a restaurant because it’s a true test of what the restaurant can do - if you mess up a simple beef burger then it’s hard for me to consider other meals on your menu. So the prime cheese burger was a test and they really passed! The burger was very simple; beef patty (so juicy, so full of flavour), cheddar cheese melted on top of some caramelized onions, a slice of tomato, a bit of lettuce, slices of cucumber, a bit of fresh onion and a freshly toasted bun - easy, simple, delicious!

The Richard’s burger only differs with the addition of bacon to the burger which was also great because who’s gonna say no to bacon?? Not sure why it’s called Richard though… who is Richard?

The pizza was a bit meh for me, especially one with such a good mix of meat i.e. chicken, beef and beef sausage…?? It was quite lacking in flavour.

The service here was exceptionally slow my goodness! The food took forever, even the starters which generally shouldn’t, really took a while. They are lucky we had no energy to leave to go elsewhere because some of us were ready to call it and just drive hungry to the hotel. The food service is slow and even getting and consolidating the bill took way too long. They overcharged us for something but weren’t accepting that fact even after we went through it with a fine tooth comb… whewww! Yeah… their service was not great. This was back in June so I would hope they’ve gotten better by now.

That aside - it’s a great place for a breakfast/lunch or dinner pitstop in Nanyuki. They have ample open space for kids to run around and One stop also has a very nice gift shop where I got some cool birthday cards. If you’ve received a birthday card from me since then just know it was bought in Nanyuki.

If I ever do go back to Nanyuki I’ll go back and see if the service is better because the food was actually quite good and worth a 2nd visit.
