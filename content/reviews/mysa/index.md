This place was a surprising find as I thought I was heading to Mythos - the Greek restaurant, only to find out that it was actually Mysa (confused the names lol). Located in the Gigiri lifestyle courtyard, Mysa doesn’t come across as a fine dining restaurant at first glance but once you sit down and get a feel of the place and the [menu](#menu)… you can tell it’s not just a casual setup.

The alfresco style of dining is a fave of mine as you know, I love anywhere with an outdoor setup and they also have a bonfire pit just before you walk into the main restaurant. Perfect for the chilly nights we’ve been experiencing of late. I came here sometime in April when the establishment was about a month old so that explains the paper menu they gave me (iykyk), I’m hoping by now they have a proper menu set up.

I came here for dinner with my friend and we were excited to try a couple of dishes. I started out with a pineapple smoulder soda (KSH400) and we had these for starters and mains: mushroom onion tart w/feta (KSH1450), steak with chimichurri (KSH1850), lamb kofta with pita bread (KSH1570) and tiramisu for dessert (KSH1050).

That pineapple smoulder soda was so good and tasted so fresh! It’s a mix of smoked pineapple, fresh thyme and soda water - 3 simple ingredients that brought about such a nice zesty freshness to the drink, definitely recommend this for the non-drinkers. I hear they have amazing cocktails too just fyi

The mushroom onion tart with feta was amazing! So tasty - loved the sweet and sour combo of the mushrooms, caramelised onions and feta and balsamic vinegar + the actual puff pastry, so good. The addition of arugula on top was the cherry on top of a perfect pastry.

The steak dish was also quite good, the steak was medium rare and soft and filled with flavour, it comes on top of a hummus spread which I found quite an interesting pairing and with shoestring fries on the side - who can say no to skinny fries?? Not me

The lamb dish was 50/50 for me - I of course was very excited to see pomegranates sprinkled over the dish, I love a good pomegranate. The lamb kofta was also very tasty, lamb is an acquired taste to some, to me it’s a taste I enjoy to an extent then it gets too much so this portion was just the right amount. The pita bread on the other hand was a bit too dense, and tasted quite bland. Pita bread is usually nice and soft but this one wasn’t as good, so that took away from the dish for me.

By the time it was time for dessert, we were way too full to try anything else but our waitress insisted we at least try the tiramisu and we could take it home if we don’t finish. The tiramisu was very fresh and made very well, equal part biscuit, equal part mascarpone cream and a nice layer of coffee powder on top with bits of chocolate sprinkled on top because why not… Great presentation, great dessert, did not finish it but it made for a great snack the next day.

The service here was spectacular. Our waitress, Monica, was on it from the moment we walked in. The place was not so busy so she let us choose a perfect spot to sit that would accommodate some warmth for me who’s always cold and still allows for a breeze for my babe who is not always cold. She gave us a great rundown of the menu and would check in to get our thoughts on each dish. She even took our post-date pics because she wanted our full fits to be seen, good looking out sis, I appreciate a girl's girl and Monica was just that. If you find her there please say a big hi, she made our experience at Mysa quite memorable.

Mysa is great for happy hour, they have happy hour events every week, it’s a good place for date night without too much pressure on dressing up etc., because of its laid back vibe and just an all round great place to wine and dine with you and your peoples
