We are in Tigoni today at the very picturesque Fig & Olive. It has such a nice, quaint farmhouse vibe, lots of bohemian decor and a very stunning vintage Ford Model A & VW Beetle right at the entrance. When you walk in you’ll be met by their retail store first which is fully stocked with unique home decor pieces, cool stationery and a variety of food products.

I’ve been here twice (once on a weekend and once on a weekday), and both times the place was equally busy so reservations are definitely required beforehand.

They have quite a small menu that changes with each season, this is intentional so that you focus on the food quality and not so much the quantity/selection. I lowkey didn’t like the fact that their brunch ends at 12… brunch should extend into the afternoon I feel but that’s just me.

The first visit was a lunch plan. I had the beef burger (KSH2000) which comes with fries and had the pineapple mint juice (KSH450) as well. My friend had one of their specials - creamy orzo (KSH1800). They make the burger medium rare by default so be sure to state your preference when ordering. The waiter should also have asked how I like it done before putting in the order because not everyone likes their burger medium rare - I’m a well done type of girl.

My well done burger was very good, so juicy, so cheesy and the patties were rich in flavour. The double patty makes the burger worth the price because it’s quite a large burger. It has pickles and sweet onions as well, the beef tasted very fresh and the burger buns were well toasted It really filled me up, couldn’t even dare to try have dessert.

The Creamy Orzo was so good! For a vegetarian dish, I was really surprised by how much I enjoyed it. Orzo is a type of pasta that looks like big grains of rice. Also super rich in flavour and that green herb butter they mixed the pasta in is so delicious! It could be a bigger portion especially given the price; it’s tasty but doesn’t fill you up as much as how the burger did.

My second visit was specifically to try their brunch which is only served from 9am until noon. We tried a few items namely: traditional scone (KSH450), fluffy pancakes (KSH1200) with a side of bacon (KSH450), Eggs Benedict (KSH1500) and a croque monsieur (KSH1650) with some coffees and fresh orange juice (KSH450)

The scone is just one scone… I feel like a pair would work better in terms of portioning. A great traditional scone nonetheless, nice and warm with a nice crunchy exterior and a soft not too crumbly interior. The clotted cream and the jam spread for said scone were immaculate! The cream is super fresh and thick and yet still melts perfectly into the scone and that jam - that jam was definitely freshly made, you could taste the berries with every bite. It feels like an unnecessarily expensive dish given the portion but it was worth every bite

The pancakes were a good portion, fluffy and filling. I love a good pancake and bacon combo so I was in heaven and the maple syrup was real maple syrup + that wonderful jam again - so good! If they start selling that jam imma find my way back to Tigoni for it.

The service here was good, the servers didn’t keep us waiting forever, and on both visits they were nice and friendly. I really love the ambience here, whether you’re seated indoors or outside in the large garden, the vibe is pretty chill and relaxing. The music is ambient and not too loud. The outdoor seating is perfect on a sunny mid-morning or afternoon, there’s plenty of green space for kids to play in, adults to bask in and they allow dogs too!

Fig & Olive is perfect for a weekend plan with your friends for a nice brunch or with your family for Sunday lunch. It’s also perfect for a date with the scenic drive to Tigoni being an added bonus It fits every occasion and has enough space for birthdays and other events. It is above average cost so again - plan your wallet well before coming here. Definitely a place I can visit again.
