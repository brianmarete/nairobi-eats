The Location is located in Kilimani, at Alta Towers to be exact. I like the play on words in the name and also a fun name to get decor inspo from judging by the big location icon right in the heart of the restaurant. It‚Äôs quite spacious and the floor to ceiling windows allows in a lot of light making it feel even bigger. The 360 view of the city is a nice bonus as well.

I came here on a Saturday for lunch with some friends, and found the place quite empty yet every table was reserved‚Ä¶ so getting a table was a problem despite the reservations being for much later in the evening. If, for example, a reservation is for 7pm‚Ä¶ and I‚Äôm there at 3pm‚Ä¶ why not let me use the table for the maybe 3hrs I‚Äôll be there and you can still have it ready for 7pm when I leave? Seems logical no?ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Anyway‚Ä¶ the menu is nice and succinct, all the food on one page and drinks on another, love that. I had the butternut soup (KSH900) to start with and we all had the southern fried sensation chicken burger (KSH1450) for mains and the molten lava cake (KSH750) for dessert.

The butternut soup was nice and rich! The ginger was too much for me so I couldn‚Äôt finish it but for the ginger lovers, you‚Äôll really love it. The garlic bread also was warm and perfectly buttered. The chicken burger was quite good, a nice big serving and the chicken wasn‚Äôt as dry. The bread was a bit too thick but I like that it was good brioche bread and not a dry bun. The fries are excellent! My friend had hers with jollof rice instead of fries and that was quite tasty too, the rice is the level of spicy you‚Äôd expect of jollof so don‚Äôt order it if you don‚Äôt like some heat with your food.

For drinks - I had the virgin kiwi mojito which was super refreshing, ended up having two! I rarely try mocktails because they‚Äôre usually too sweet but of late I‚Äôve been finding some really good ones and this was one of them.

The dessert however‚Ä¶ that molten lava cake, took FOREVER to be served. I probably waited a good 40+ minutes for it. They told me it would take a while but didn‚Äôt expect to wait close to an hour for a dessert that small goodness. When it finally came, I have to admit it did taste great. Very chocolatey, rich, fresh and moist. But there was no chocolate lava in it whatsoever‚Ä¶ nothing poured out like the lava it‚Äôs named after, why? We shall never know lol

The service was just okay, nothing bad to report. The ambience of the place is very chill, nice vibes and being a rooftop bar, it gives off a nice mature vibe. I found it odd that they have a pool that no one can enter, it was literally built just for aesthetics. Would have made for a bomb pool part if they let people swim in it but then again, it‚Äôs on the 13th floor so it‚Äôs a bit of a hazard still.

The location is a great place to go for drinks with friends, great for birthdays or other special events and even for dates. The music on that day was exceptional - shoutout DJ Samdo! It‚Äôs not super loud but I assume it gets louder later in the evenings.

This is a place that I can‚Äôt say I‚Äôd be constantly returning to unless I have to, but I won‚Äôt write it off either as never again.
