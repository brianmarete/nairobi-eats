Sea Wolf in Brooklyn came highly recommended by some friends and reviews online seemed mostly positive so I was excited to try some fish in the big apple finally.

We ordered a few different things to try - the spicy shrimp basket, fish and chips, San Diego style fish tacos, grilled chicken salad and a classic burger. The only thing I enjoyed here was the spicy shrimp… The fish in the fish & chips was covered in a cake level of batter, I couldn’t eat past one bite. The tacos were too plain… like why?? Grilled chicken salad is exactly what it is - grilled chicken and salad, nothing exciting there. And the burger was just okay.

Quite underwhelmed by this place given how much it’s talked about online. I think people enjoy the drinks here more than the food so maybe that’s why it’s so popular. My friends really enjoyed their drinks and they don’t mince on the alcohol at all.

Personally… I wouldn’t recommend it for their food, maybe just for happy hour.
