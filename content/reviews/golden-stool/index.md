As always, I noticed the decor first. Love love the decor. There’s a particular velvet chair with roses on the back that I want in my living room but let me stop digressing sorry… (But if anyone knows who did their outfitting let me know please)

I’ve not had a lot of West African food so I was quite excited to taste all the peppery goodness because I’m a lover of all things spice.

For starters we had the Kelewele which I now know is a fried plantain snack. I’m not a fan of plantains (msiniue please!) but I actually managed to enjoy this, the coating was so good making me forget it was actual plantain. I also had the Suya Goat… guys that mbuzi literally melted in my mouth, it was so tender, and the flavour packed a good punch!

For mains, I opted for fried pork with Jollof rice & it comes with some Shito sauce on the side. My friend had the palava soup which is a nice thick stew filled with goat meat, greens, mixed together with spices, sauces & topped off with a boiled egg, also comes with Jollof.

Everything was so yum! Enjoyed the jollof rice, first time having Ghanaian jollof and I feel like they’re winning that Ghana/Nigerian jollof war. The meats are grilled and seasoned well, and it has just the right amount of spice. The service was great, and the prices were quite good too. I think this is a place I’ll be going to often whenever I’m in the Village Market area.
