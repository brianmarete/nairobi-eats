Frangos is a Portuguese style restaurant, their focus being their chicken. I had the lemon & herb half chicken which comes with two sides of your choice, I had coleslaw and corn on the cob. Loved the chicken, very moist, very flavourful, and the corn had a nice chilli added to it as well. The coleslaw was just average. My friend had the rice option as a side which I tried and really liked how well spiced it is.

We then had churros for dessert which I was super excited for because - churros! They are served with two dips, a chilli chocolate sauce and a ginger caramel, both were really tasty!

The place itself is quite nice, looks very bistro/bar-esque, the service was on point. The prices though are a bit steep, think I saw 6 wings for KSH1500? My dish was KSH1600 and the churros were KSH750.
