    description: "This was my best find this year and it almost never happened! Bang Bang Thai definitely delivered some banging thai food with each visit (yes I went more than once) and the leftovers banged even more. I must make it to Thailand in my future if the food is anything to go by🤤"
  - title: "Salty Squid ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️"

    description: "An absolute fave! If you are ever in Diani, please make it a point to visit Salty Squid be it for breakfast, lunch or dinner - or even a cheeky happy hour as you watch the sunset over the Indian ocean. You will not regret it AND you’ll be extremely well fed. I love that it’s right by the beach, getting sundowners with your people catching a most magical sunset is giving top tier holiday vibes."
  - title: "Mythos Taverna ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️"

    image: "https://pub-4724642652e24a15ae8859ce2d274595.r2.dev/top-2025/mythos-taverna.jpg"
    description: "The Greek made a big impression when Mythos Taverna landed in Nairobi - those food portions could feed a whole town! Can we also talk about the decor?? STUNNING. The vibe, the views, the food, the visuals… so much detail, flavour and oomph that it makes you feel like you are literally sitting by a seaside tavern in Mykonos. I really enjoyed Mythos a lot."
  - title: "Uncle Nene’s ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️"
    link: "/reviews/uncle-nenes"
    image: "https://pub-4724642652e24a15ae8859ce2d274595.r2.dev/top-2025/uncle-nenes.jpg"
    description: "I found my best burger of 2025! Uncle Nene’s have the key to a good burger down i.e. fresh flavours, no extra pizazz to distract you from the taste, it’s filling and those crinkle cut fries will have you ordering more immediately you’re done eating - so good! (Check out my best burger of 2024 here🙃)"
  - title: "270º Rooftop ⭐️⭐️⭐️.5"
    link: "/reviews/270-rooftop"
    image: "https://pub-4724642652e24a15ae8859ce2d274595.r2.dev/top-2025/270-rooftop.jpg"
    description: "Contributing to the growing rooftop culture in Nairobi, 270º provided such great vibes with every visit. Be it a date, a business lunch or dinner with your girls; the food is amazing, the drinks spectacular and being romanced by the dusk sky and the twinkling lights overlooking the city skyline isn’t such a bad idea💫"
  - title: "Karak & Go ⭐️⭐️⭐️"
    link: "/reviews/karak-and-go"
    image: "https://pub-4724642652e24a15ae8859ce2d274595.r2.dev/top-2025/karak-and-go.jpg"
    description: "This is for all the coffee and the matcha lovers in the house. Karak & Go came and painted Nairobi matcha green with their signature (and very popular) matcha vanilla lattes. My obsession though, is the iced brown sugar shaken espresso… an iced coffee after my own heart🤎 PS: Add an extra shot of espresso in it for that perfect caffeine boost😉"
