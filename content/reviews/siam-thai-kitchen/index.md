Talking about another cloud kitchen turned dine-in restaurant today! Siam Thai Kitchen is one of 7 brands under the [Ando Foods](https://twitter.com/andokitchens) umbrella and I love that their family just keeps getting bigger and bigger! (Still waiting on that dessert brand👀)

As the name suggests, Siam is a Thai restaurant serving up nothing but good authentic Thai cuisine and coming from the Ando brand, I really expect nothing less. They opened quite a while back but I didn’t get to try anything from there until a few weeks ago.

Of course my first order was always going to be Pad Thai, I love a good noodle dish. I’m not super familiar with Thai food outside of that dish and green curry so I can’t say much on it but I’m always happy to try any Asian cuisine because that continent has mastered the culinary arts to a T.

I got the Pad Thai with chicken (KSH1020/) and the aroma that filled the room when that food arrived… wow! I was ready. The portion was a good size, perfect for one person. It comes with a nice sweet & savoury sauce you can pour all over the noodles, giving the meal a nice kick to it.

Pad Thai is essentially a stir fry of fried rice noodles, scrambled egg, chicken (or the protein of your choice), bean sprouts and peanuts. This Ando rendition has some red chillies added to it which I loved because I love a bit of fire in my food. This dish is a quick and easy street food meal over in Thailand and really became super popular with how often people recreate the dish all over the world.
I enjoyed it more than I thought I would. I ate every single noodle, peanut, chicken and bean sprout🤤 The combination of flavours and spices and the sauce, the crunch of the peanuts and the burst of tartness from the lemon wedges… a perfect harmony of taste in my mouth. So good!

I will say though, that the noodles were a tad bit oily, like oiler than they should be for sure but that didn’t stop me from eating every morsel. Nitachoma mafuta this 2024😅

I’m yet to try anything else from here but if this first dish is anything to go by, Ando, once again, have proved that they know how to whip up some tasty cuisines. They recently just opened a dine-in restaurant at Nairobi Street Kitchen so if you’re ever on that side of town and craving some yummy noodles, try it out and let me know your experience.
