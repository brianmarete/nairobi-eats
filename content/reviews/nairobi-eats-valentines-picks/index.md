    description: "This is without a doubt one of the best places to wine and dine someone you really want to impress. Fine dining with impeccable service and a really interesting menu that will make for great conversation starters. Make your reservations early, this place is bound to get filled up quick come Feb 14th.<br> <strong><em>Budget for 2: KSH6000+</em></strong>"

    description: "For the wine lovers, this one’s for you. Cave à manger is not only a stunning restaurant with great food but it also boasts a vast wine collection with pairings expertly made by their in-house sommeliers. It’s very much also fine dining but doesn’t come across so prim and proper and leaves room for a bit of fun dining in their open plan setup under the Nairobi blue sky.<br><strong><em>Budget for 2: KSH5000+</em></strong>"

    description: "A classic! Talisman is a great eclectic mix of casual and fine dining with pockets of intimate spots in their establishment that will let you have a cozy time with your date without interference from peering eyes. The service is top notch and they serve a good variety of dishes, you’ll both be spoilt for choice.<br><strong><em>Budget for 2: KSH5000+</em></strong>"

    image: "https://pub-4724642652e24a15ae8859ce2d274595.r2.dev/Valentines-2025/Beit.jpeg"
    description: "Beit is a mixed bag for some people because of its limited menu but I absolutely love everything about this place. I’ve always enjoyed the food and I really love how the ambience really transports you away from the hustle and bustle of Nairobi especially given that they’re right in the heart of Westlands. Whether it’s a lunch or dinner plan, a date here can go on for hours if the company is good because the vibes really give off nice and chill, romance but not too in your face - just the right amount of intimate without feeling too much pressure.Pro-tip: Do not drive here, there is barely any parking. <br><strong><em>Budget for 2: KSH4000+</em></strong>"

    description: "Not every day dinner plans for Valentine’s day, sometimes brunch is a much better idea and Wasp & Sprout is one of the best places to try this Valentine’s day. They have a brunch menu with lots of options for the breakfast lovers like myself and lunch options as well and I think this would work well for those who don’t want too much pressure for this day i.e. fancy restaurant etc, you just want to spend quality time with your person without either of you having to fuss too much over what to wear etc. Come for good food, enjoy talking over some coffee and OJ and just have a good time in each other's company:) Pro-tip: they have a gift shop upstairs if you wanna get him/her something special!. <br><strong><em>Budget for 2: KSH3500+</em></strong>"

    description: "I like that we have so many options in this day and age. We can go out to dinner, for brunch, for a simple coffee date OR we can also stay in and order in for Valentine’s day. That’s where ANDO foods come in handy. Their umbrella of 7 restaurants gives you so many options to choose from, you can have your pick from Khan’s biryani to Marty's burgers, to Dilli’s yummy indian curries or some pad thai from Siam Thai kitchen, creamy pasta from little italy etc… They have fresh drinks and desserts available as well. Plate it the way you want, add some flowers and a little gift and you’ve got yourself a thoughtful yet effortless at home date:)<br><strong><em>Budget for 2: KSH3000+</em></strong>"

    description: "Another classic date spot! Sierra will never fail you (unless you fail to make reservations on time…). They have food, service and ambience on lock for this special day. Fine dining and a space that gives off grown and sexy vibes be it day or night. Make those reservations early, nimekuwarn lol. <br><strong><em>Budget for 2: KSH5000+</em></strong>"

    image: "https://pub-4724642652e24a15ae8859ce2d274595.r2.dev/Valentines-2025/Zengarden.jpeg"
    description: "Yet another place that provides the right amount of romance vibes without being too cliche, Zen garden really envelopes you in its stunning space. They have a most stunning garden setup for those who would like to dine under the stars and their indoor setup isn’t one to be missed either. I don’t know who sources their roses but they have a fresh collection every other day that will probably rival any bouquet you bring with you - bring it still, it’ll add to the experience. The food is wonderful, in large portions and exciting to try for those who love an asian inspired menu. <br><strong><em>Budget for 2: KSH6000+</em></strong>"

    description: "This is for the ones who like a bit of fun to accompany their date nights. Hero makes for a great Valentine’s day dinner plan if you’re an adventurous pair ready to try bits and bobs from their superhero inspired menu as well as fun and flirty drinks from their bar which has been listed in the <a href='https://www.theworlds50best.com/discovery/Establishments/Kenya/Nairobi/Hero-Bar.html' target='_blank'>World’s 50 best bars</a>! <br><strong><em>Budget for 2: KSH5000+</em></strong>"

    description: "If you can get Friday off from work, I highly recommend taking your Valentine’s plan out of Nairobi just for the day. Take a scenic drive to Tigoni and have a a romantic brunch/lunch/dinner at Fig & Olive, this would also work for Galentine's day out for you and your girlies. The fresh air and the fresh outdoors will be a breath of fresh air for you both and there’s just something about being out of nairobi even for a few hours that makes everything feel so much lighter and free. This is a more relaxed but still sweet and intentional plan that your person will always remember. Due to its popularity, I highly recommend making reservations asaptually.<br><strong><em>Budget for 2: KSH4000+</em></strong>"

The season of love is around the corner and I want my guys and girls to stay ready so they don’t have to get ready:) I’ve compiled a small list of places that I think would make for a great Valentine’s lunch/dinner plan for you and your significant other/s (we listen and don’t judge over here lol).
