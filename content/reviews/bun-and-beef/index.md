So I don’t find myself in Village market often but on the rare chance that I am, I make time to try out a new eatery there. On my last visit I decided to try out Bun & Beef which came quite highly recommended from a couple people.

Bun & Beef is located in the new wing of the village market at the food court. So it’s mostly a stall where you can make your order and pay and then you can have your meal in the general food court seating area.

I came here for lunch with a friend and we were excited for some yummy smash burgers! Our server suggested we try their popular Oklahoma burger (KSH1200) and I opted to also try the mushroom double burger (KSH1400). The burgers come with a side of plain/cajun fries and it’s KSH100 extra if you’d like sweet potato fries instead.

The Oklahoma burger consists of a smashed beef patty, caramelized onions, Swiss cheese, pickles, their signature smash sauce and the burger potato buns. We both were not fans of this burger unfortunately. The onions didn’t taste or look as caramelized and I'm already not a big onion fan so when they’re not cooked as they’re supposed to be cooked.. it really overpowers the taste of the burger for me. I had maybe two bites and gave up.

The double mushroom burger consists of two smashed beef patties, swiss cheese, sautéed mushrooms, crispy onions and pickles, garlic aioli and the potato buns. This burger had a much better taste profile. The flavours were more pronounced and the onions were actually caramelized! I think I would have added some jalapeños to it to give it some spiciness but my friend doesn’t do too well with spices so had to stop myself from adding any.

The plain fries were over-fried and way too salty (coming from me who takes a lot of salt, then you know it’s very very salty). I didn't enjoy these fries. The sweet potato fries however were excellent! Very tasty and would have ordered more to carry home with me but we must practice self-control apparently

Bun & Beef didn’t hit the mark for me. It's not somewhere I’d visit or order from again, no offence to those who enjoy it, this is just my opinion.
