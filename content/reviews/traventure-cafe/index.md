Located in the leafy suburbs of Gigiri, Traventure cafe feels very welcoming from the onset and I think that’s mostly because it was someone’s home before. You get into the lobby/living room area and you’re immediately drawn to the back garden where the majority of the restaurant sits.

There’s lots of seating areas, lots of greenery, lots of grass and a swimming pool! So you can already tell this is a more big group, family style setting. The sun was out the day I went here which made for a perfect Sunday brunch day😊

The menu is fun, with little design elements alluding to various cities, passport stamps and airport fonts - giving very much travel vibes😄 This is my second time here because on my 1st visit, I didn’t get enough time to try the food so had to come back. My friend and I were in the mood for breakfast (as always 😅) so I got a coffee and pancakes (KSH700) with bacon on the side (KSH150), while she got the Jane Kado breakfast (KSH1200). The rest of the group were more in the lunch mood so they got: the beef burger (KSH1100), chicken wings (KSH800), and the beef steak (KSH1950).

Our drinks were served to us in good time but the food took quite some time. This is the same issue I had the last time - the service was extremely slow leading to me cancelling my order. This time - with time to spare, the food service still took way too long, especially for something as simple as pancakes and bacon. That’s one thing I think they really need to work on.

That aside - the pancakes were nice and fluffy, I did enjoy them. I would have liked more strawberries (I always want more berries lol) but as an entire meal, I was satisfied. The wings were good but the sweet & hot sauce wasn’t hot at all, it was more sweet than anything else so just be wary of that. The fries were perfect. The beef steak portion felt a bit small to me but it didn’t lack taste. The burger was just okay. The Jane Kado breakfast looked divine! I don’t eat avocado (if you’re new here, hi, welcome to the anti-avocado club👋🏾) but if I did, that’s a meal I would have devoured. It was a perfect balance of healthy and yummy and it also comes with fresh toast👌🏾

The wait staff are very friendly and some of them are hearing impaired so they’ll usually come round with a pen and paper for those who can’t sign. Traventure has such a homey vibe to it that it didn’t feel like we had to leave or like we were taking up space. The vast compound gives space for big groups to dine and enjoy, there was a whole bridal shower happening in the same space and it didn’t inconvenience us or other patrons at all.

There is more space by the pool where you can have events, pool parties (with advance notice); I’ve attended a birthday here and you’d be amazed how stunning the pool looks with a backdrop of fairy lights and balloons🎈

All in all I enjoyed my time here. The only thing I wasn’t too happy about was the slow food service - they should work on that👌🏾 It’s a great place for events like game nights, Sunday lunch, birthdays, casual friend meet ups etc. It’s great for families, especially those with young kids - they’ll have space to run around, and they can swim if the weather allows for it.
