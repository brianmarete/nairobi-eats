The Liquor Library is located in the lush Tigoni neighbourhood, just about a 45min from Nairobi. First thing to note - they need better signage. It really took us forever to find the right turn to get here because there’s no signage on the main road right up until you drive into the compound… not very useful even for a ‘hidden gem’.

That aside - the place is set in a beautiful landscape overlooking a stunning tea farm. One thing about the Limuru area, you’re gonna get some views! It’s all outdoor seating with plenty of spots for picnics and chilling. We were here on a Sunday afternoon and it only started getting filled up with people at sunset hour as we were getting ready to leave. So it looks like people come here around 5/6pm for sundowners as opposed to earlier in the afternoon for lunch.

There is no physical or scanning menu - why? I have no clue. I tried to look it up online so I can have something to share with you guys here but there’s no digital menu on their website - and I also saw that someone didn’t complete the job properly on the site… Hopefully they see this and rectify that, placeholder text on your main website in 2025 is a rookie mistake.

The waiter just told us what they have ready in the kitchen and that’s what we ordered i.e. dry fry pork, wet fry pork and goat, grilled chicken, mukimo, ugali, pilau, sukuma na sauté potatoes/chips. Can’t recall the prices of anything here, apologies, but this is why a physical menu is important.

For drinks - which is the Liquor Library’s selling point, there is also no physical menu, you have to walk up to the main house where the bar is and order all drinks from there. I found that quite inconvenient.

The food was just okay, it’s just typical food from your local joint, in fact I think what I liked most was the pilau. The dry pork was too dry, very little flavour. Service was slow but we were also a big group so our waiter really tried his best.

I think the only thing selling this place is the ambience. All that greenery and fresh crisp Tigoni air is worth the drive if you’re looking for somewhere outside in nature to chill with friends, family or your SO. The afternoon sun is so yummy against your skin as you’re lazing on the grass and the sunset against the tea farm hills is a marvel

Looks like a perfect place for events with the amount of open space they have, and I’ve seen some cool events happen here before so if you’re looking for an event space just a bit outside Nairobi, check out The Liquor Library Tigoni.

They need to work on their service and their food though + provide a menu to customers, just my two cents.
