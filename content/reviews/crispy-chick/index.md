There’s so many eateries popping up every other week, it’s so hard to keep up with all of them. One place though that’s only been in business for just a few months is already making a mark in the industry - a super crispy mark at that.

Crispy Chick is a cloud kitchen that’s serving some very delectable fried chicken😋 Who doesn’t like fried chicken? Add different flavour varieties and I’m inside that story kabisa! Funfact - Crispy Chick is under the same brand as the [Ayeyo]({{< relref "/ayeyo">}}) restaurant.

I attended the colourful launch of Crispy Chick back in October of last year and we had our fair share of fried chicken, chicken wings, chicken burgers, well crafted cocktails and of course freshly made fries. We were introduced to the brand and given a taste of what was coming into the market.

Fast forward a few weeks later, I decided to finally try some of this crispy chicken at home and here are my thoughts…

My first try was the sweet & sassy fried chicken (KSH850/). I had this with some regular fries, delivery was swift and the food was well packaged (the packaging is also another great thing to note but lemme not geek out on that too much here🙈).

For those who know me or you’ve followed my reviews for some time, you know I’m a big sweet tooth and an even bigger lover of anything sweet + savoury! This sweet and sassy chicken really hit the spot on that. The fried chicken is perfectly coated with a batter so crunchy… KFC has nothing on this! It’s doused in a honey & sweet jalapeño sauce giving it that sweetness and that kick of spice from the jalapeño😋 The chicken itself is moist and flavourful, speaking to the level of marination it went through. The portions are great given the price - you get two healthy pieces of fried chicken and a nice chunk of fries on the side.

The second time I tried Crispy Chick I opted for the Korean fried chicken. At the launch I had a taste of the Korean fried chicken burger and it was very delicious, I wanted to see if the chicken on its own would fit the bill as well.

This time around I decided to order off of their own food app - Food Dash. I hate having to download new apps but this is mostly for you guys so you can decide if it’s worth trying or sticking to UberEats etc. The app isn’t too bad, quite straightforward, delivery fees here are KSH220/ and it takes the same amount of time for delivery.

I got the Korean crispy chicken with seasoned tangy fries (KSH950/) and a side of apple slaw (KSH250/). Y’all… the size of these pieces of chicken though?? I appreciate it so much. A nice thick thigh and breast is a good combo to really fill you up. I could smell the gochujang sauce the chicken was coated with as soon as I opened the box🥹 I love Korean Fried Chicken and I like that these guys were willing to make their own version of it including making their own homemade gochujang sauce.

I only have one critique about this dish and it’s about the batter. It was way too thick. The crust, though crunchy yes, was super thick and really takes away from the joy of getting a bite of chicken + the fried crust. Not sure why this version I got was thicker than the sweet & sassy from my last order but yeah… had to remove most of it just to be able to at least eat more of the chicken. Korean fried chicken generally has a slightly thinner crust, so this was a bit much for me. The flavours were hitting though🔥 That chicken was well seasoned and the sauce coating the chicken was so good - a bit of sweet, a bit of salty, a bit of pepper and everything in between.

The tangy fries were fresh & in plenty, I appreciated that too and that apple slaw my goodness🤤 Always order that apple slaw with your meal, you’ll thank me later. I haven’t tried any of the burgers yet because I worry about how the burger will travel on delivery. The burgers we had during the launch were so good though, especially because they were freshly made there. I tried the scorchin southern crispy wings on that day too - and they are VERY scorchin🥵 Just how I like anything spicy to be.

For dessert they have fudge brownies (KSH390/) and chocolate chip cookies (KSH240/). I’ve only tried the cookies and they were a tad too sweet for me (yes, me the sweet tooth🙈) but maybe others will enjoy them, for me they were too sugary.

So far Ayeyo has been a delight, Crispy Chick is doing well too, excited to see what the team comes up with next!
