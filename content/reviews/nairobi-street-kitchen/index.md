This place had people in a chokehold back in 2021 when they just opened! Been here maybe a total of two times only. The parking situation already usually puts me off from going back but I digress… I really like the street-esque look of the place, the graffiti and the artwork is dope but also… hatukuli vibes.

I tried a few different things - the tacos, teriyaki chicken & piri piri chicken from the bird exchange place and some gyoza from the noodle joint. The tacos were filling but not as flavourful as I’d have liked, especially the fish tacos which happen to be my favourite type of tacos. What I appreciate is the fish wasn’t super deep fried where you only taste batter and no fish.

The teriyaki chicken thighs were good, possibly the best thing I had there and the fries from bird exchange were really good, well salted. The piri piri chicken wasn’t hot at all… I had to ask for hot sauce to add to it. The gyoza is a no please, those were just samosas shaped as dumplings. I still maintain that [Chekafe]({{< relref "/chekafe">}}) has the best dumplings:)

Drinks (according to my friend because I don’t drink) the cocktails from the Mexican joint were really good, generous amount of booze, cocktails from the bar upstairs, quite watery, very little alcohol. I don’t know if this has since changed, y’all can update me…

I personally didn’t mind the place, the art lover in me really loved the interior design & decor, whoever did the outfitting of the place did a superb job. Foodwise - it’s not somewhere I’ve been longing to go back to to try their other options like pizzas & burgers… maybe one day.
