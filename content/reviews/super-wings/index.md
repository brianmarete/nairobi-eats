This is yet another Ando Foods creation, and it is also delivery only. They focus on a variety of wings and I’m not a major wings person but since I’ve enjoyed Ando’s other brands, figured it won’t hurt to try. So far I’ve tried 4 out of their 8 wing flavours - Lemon pepper, Sticky Asian, Classic BBQ & Thai Chilli Mango.
Lemme start with the one I love the most - Lemon Pepper. The lemon pepper is a classic wing flavour & it never fails, ever! They’ve really got this one right flavourwise, the wings are so so good! You can taste the tart of the lemon and the spice of the pepper perfectly.

Sticky Asian wings - another fave, I’ve tried these more than once and I love the combination of sweet and spicy plus the stickyness of the honey they toss the wings in - so good! Top flavour choice.

Classic BBQ - I was excited to try this because I love anything bbq flavoured but sadly these fell flat. I didn’t like them because they didn’t taste like bbq at all to me - not sure what they used to make the sauce but it’s a no for me.

The Thai Chilli Mango - I was also very excited to try these because I LOVE mangoes. These were just okay… the sauce was a bit too sweet for me, there was very little chilli and I think had there been more spice, it would have balanced the sweet of the mango better.

If you notice from the pictures below there’s always a new flavour + the lemon pepper ones. that’s how much I love those lemon pepper wings!
