Today we’re talking about the underrated Pot Belly restaurant & bar. I had not heard about this place until a few months ago and I immediately paid a visit when I discovered it along Matundu lane in Westlands.

Their decor is quite simple, a little too simple for me. However, I think we know by now that what a place lacks in decor it makes up for it 10x more with the food! The menu is quite vast and offers a good variety of items. Their focus is more Indian with sprinkles of continental food here and there.

I came here for dinner with a friend and it was really raining that night so all I wanted was some rich comfort food. We decided to get some mutton kebabs in a blanket (KSH1000) as starters, tikka chicken (KSH1200) and some butter chicken (KSH1000) + a couple pieces of fresh butter naan (KSH180).

Those kebabs in a blanket follow me in my dreams - amazing! The mutton was so delish and the softness of that butter naan all rolled into one? I’d like some more please So good and very easy to eat so many at once.

The chicken tikka (boneless) was also very flavourful but it lacked that hit of spice chicken tikka usually has, not sure why because we did ask for spicy but still tasty nonetheless.

The butter chicken was just the right amount of warm comfort I needed on such a cold rainy day - so rich, juicy pieces of chicken, that very lush curry that lingers on your tongue after every bite… butter chicken will always be famous!

The pot belly is a very family style restaurant, it’s quite spacious and the seating arrangement allows for a good number of group dining. The service was nice and quick and the prices are very friendly too.

It’s a great place for family lunches/dinners, office team lunches/dinners and even great for hangouts with friends or date nights. The food is wonderful and it’s definitely a place I will be going back to.
