It's been a while since I’ve been here so I’m going off of memory. 1st of all - I must comment on decor… It’s a really well-outfitted place, feels very by the ocean without the ocean. The daybed section kwanza, top notch… I don’t know if they still have it but if they do, that’s the best section to sit at.

The menu has a lot of variety, my friend and I tried a couple of different things, chicken lollipops and prawn summer rolls for starters, both were really good. I had baby back ribs with sweet corn and coleslaw and she had the pili pili prawn pizza. The pizza was fantastic! I actually stopped eating my ribs and just had the pizza with her because of how good it was, the spices combined with the sauce and of course the prawns - perfect! Not that the ribs were bad, they weren’t, they were also great, fall-off-the-bone soft but that pizza really won my heart:)

For dessert, we had the passion fruit chocolate chip ice cream which to me was a 10/10. I feel like it’s a bit too pricey (KSH1350) though for just about two scoops of ice cream but maybe it’s the making of it that justifies the cost??

Downside though was the service was very very slow. The manager said they were quite understaffed that day but the place wasn’t even halfway full so it shouldn’t have taken more than an hour for us to even get drinks at least. I did go back again after that visit and the service had improved slightly… I hope that it’s much better presently - y’all can let me know. I hear that it’s become more of a club now than a restaurant & that’s unfortunate.

I must say that I really enjoyed the food though, when it eventually got to us lol and if they finally move locations or sort out their noise disturbance issue - I may return just for that prawn pizza.
