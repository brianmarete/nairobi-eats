This beautiful rooftop garden restaurant is located in Westlands at Delta Towers. For those who remember it took up the space where Buddha Bad used to be. I haven’t been to peppertree in a very long time, probably in like four years now.

It’s not somewhere that really left a mark on me foodwise so I never thought to go back but as this was a birthday dinner plan, I decided to go and see if anything’s changed over the years.

The outfitting is still as stunning as ever. I love the vibrant colours and the murals surrounding the room, the big windows give you a nice view of westy and build on the ambience and the spread out chandelier of hanging plants give it such a tropical vibe👌🏾 Decor is on point but as I always say… you can eat ambience so let’s talk food.

The menu is nice and succinct and it has a little bit of everything. Bitings, mains, cocktails, desserts. Peppertree is popular mostly for their tacos. We got a few to sample i.e. The Ethiopian style lamb (Tibs) tacos, the pork and pineapple tacos and the roast mushroom tacos (KSH1350 for 3). I also got the pork ribs that comes with fries and coleslaw (KSH2500)

I enjoyed the lamb tacos the most out of the two. I usually gravitate towards pork and even the last time I was at Peppertree I got the same pork & pineapple tacos and I remember not liking them as much. Something to do with the flavour, it didn’t give off much flavour even with the pickled onions and the salsa…

These lamb ones however! Once I removed the guac - (yes, I had the guacamole removed because avocados aren’t my cup of tea), I got to enjoy a most delicious medley of flavours between the spiced lamb bits, the Berbere aioli and the Yemeni Zhoug (a spicy middle eastern sauce), such a yummy taco! I could easily eat more than three of them.

I didn’t get to try the roast mushroom but I like that it had feta cheese on top of it, that tart flavour is always a great addition.

The pork ribs dish was quite generous, they don’t mince on portions here which I appreciate. The ribs themselves were drowning in that sweet BBQ sauce so that really took away from the flavour of the pork itself. It felt like all I was eating was sweet BBQ sauce lol and yes I like sweet things but BBQ ribs shouldn’t be overwhelmingly sweet I feel but that’s just me. The slaw was not giving at all - it has way too much mayo for my liking😬

We didn’t have time or any room left for dessert so I may try that next time (hopefully it won’t be another four years🙈). The service was decent, nothing major, nothing minor. It was a Thursday and the place was nicely packed, not extremely full but they definitely get their fair share of customers.

Peppertree feels like a nice place for big dinners like birthdays, big friend groups, family dinners etc. I don’t know if I’d come here for a date, I prefer a more cozy/intimate setting for that but for those who don’t mind a vast open space - take that special lady or man out to Peppertree today. The booths along the sides will give you more than enough privacy for your conversations👌🏾
