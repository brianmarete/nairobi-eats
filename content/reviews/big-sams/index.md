Big Sam’s Pâtisserie is an artisan dessert studio known for its elegant pastries, handcrafts chocolates, chunky and yummy cookies and mousse cakes. Founded by Sam Ayany, an internationally trained pastry chef whose love for dessert has him bringing in a blend of French technique and global flavours with a Kenyan twist to his decadent desserts.

Sam so kindly sent me a few packs of his unique chocolates and cookies to sample and share my thoughts with you all.

First of all - can you look at the packaging! As a designer, I’m a sucker for great packet design and this packaging is really well done. The black is a striking colour which you don’t see a lot in packaging and the choice of orange for the branding against the black was a good one. I could go on and on but this isn’t a graphic design class so lemme stop.

- These are the various treats I got to try:
- Milk Chocolate Salted Caramel Bon Bon (KSH1260)
- Whiskey dark chocolate Bon Bon (KSH1200)
- Dark chocolate chip cookies (KSH950)
- Red velvet white chocolate brownies (KSH1050)
- Dark chocolate crunchy brownies (KSH1400)
- Milk chocolate walnut cookies (KSH630)
- Chocolate pecan caramel cookies (KSH700)
- Cherry almond financier (KSH650)

Before I get into specifics… how stunning are these chocolate pieces?? I love the intricate designs and the chocolate itself is so delicate, not too thick, not too thin and the filling is just the right amount of ooey gooey-ness.

Okay now let’s get into specifics:

The Milk Chocolate Salted Caramel Bon Bon: the caramel is at a good sweet level but needs more richness of flavour in terms of salted caramel. The chocolate itself tasted more of dark chocolate than milk chocolate. These come 9 in a pack.

The Whiskey Dark Chocolate Bon Bon 53%: the filling didn’t taste of as much whiskey as I thought it would but I didn’t mind it. I like the dark chocolate on this one - it’s not too bitter which is nice - it’s about 53% dark chocolate. These come 9 in a pack.

The Dark Chocolate Chip Cookies: These are made of 80% Ugandan chocolate and they were so tasty! I’m not the biggest fan of dark chocolate but these were actually quite good. The balance of the dark chocolate in the cookie is perfect and the cookie was so gooey and moist, so yum! These come 6 in a pack.

The Red Velvet White Chocolate Brownies: I love the silver leaf detail. It’s very rich in flavour and quite sweet because white chocolate is very sweet. The crunch is a nice touch for a brownie. These come 8 in a pack.

The Dark Chocolate Crunchy Brownies: I also love the gold leaf detail on this. These brownies are very very rich. Whewww! The dark in the chocolate really comes out here, it’s so much chocolate! For the chocolate lovers, y’all will love this. It was way too rich for me though. These come 8 in a pack.

Milk Chocolate Walnut Cookies: I found these quite sweet and the nuttiness doesn’t come out as much. These come 6 in a pack.

Chocolate Pecan Caramel Cookies: these are made of 55% dark chocolate. The cookies are so fluffy, so airy and so gooey! I loved them! The dollops of caramel sauce aren’t too sweet so it balances well with the sweetness of the cookie. The pecan pieces provide a nice crunch to the soft cookie:) These come 6 in a pack.

Cherry Almond financier: This is my first time trying a financier - a small French almond cake flavoured with beurre noisette (a type of brown butter). This one has cherry filling and is nice and soft, so fresh and so tasty! I’m not the biggest fan of cherries but I actually liked this pastry.

Big Sam’s Pâtisserie Chocolaterie is a great place to get gifts for your loved ones especially those with a sweet tooth They’re a perfect addition to a gift, attached to a bouquet of flowers, or even solo and no wrapping paper needed because the packaging is already presentable enough.
