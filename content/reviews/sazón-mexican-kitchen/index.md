I had the chance to visit the fairly new Mexican spot called Sazón a few weeks back. I had been wanting to try it for a while because it reminds me so much of the US food chain Chipotle which I love so much! Located at Westfield Mall, Sazón is a nice little eatery serving up fresh Mexican dishes, bringing a nice burst of colorful cuisine to the Nairobi food scene.

The place is quite small with at most 2 - 3 tables set up outside so it’s not a place for in-person dining, much better for delivery. I came here for lunch with my friend and we sampled a few things from their menu: a burrito bowl (KSH950) and a burrito (KSH1000) + some chips and salsa (KSH250)

My burrito bowl had chicken, pinto beans, brown rice, shredded lettuce, sweet corn salsa, green salsa and a handful of shredded cheese on top. The burrito is assembled the same way except everything goes on a warm tortilla instead of a bowl - my friend had the shredded beef instead of chicken and of course hers had guacamole whereas mine did not

I really enjoyed my burrito bowl, it was very filling, very tasty and it can aptly fit two meals since it’s such a big portion. What I didn’t like was the cheese they used, it was shredded mozzarella which isn’t a bad choice but mozzarella doesn’t melt as easily and the rubbery taste doesn’t pair as well with the food. Shredded cheddar cheese would have worked better.

The burrito was possibly the largest burrito I’ve ever seen, even Chipotle doesn’t compare! It's sliced in half so it's perfect for two people or two meals, you can start with one half and have the other half later. I love their portions, especially at their prices - really good value for money.

The chips (crisps) for the chips and salsa were not great, they were definitely over fried, all I could taste was oil so those weren’t great but I liked their green salsa a lot.

They don’t serve drinks here other than sodas and water. Sazón are doing well so far in their first year of operation, I think the food is good and really fresh, and they are quite affordable as well. I hope in the coming year they’ll be able to move to a bigger location where dining in will be possible.
