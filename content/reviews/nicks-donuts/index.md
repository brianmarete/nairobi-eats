We’re talking about snacks today! I’ve been hearing and seeing a lot about Nick’s donuts for possibly over a year now but never really paid attention until recently. I’m not the biggest donut fan, I find them too doughy for my liking but these ones looked different from the classic donut so figured why not give them a try.

Thanks to my friend’s suggestion, I took a drive to their Gigiri location because their lavington location is just a pickup point. The Gigiri one may as well be the same because it barely has any space for more than two people to sit and chill but I think that’s the idea - just order, pick and go.

The idea of Nick’s donuts is that you get to customise this classic pastry to your liking with a variety of fillings, glazes, drizzle and toppings. This is especially fun for kids because they can really go wild😄

Their menu has plenty of flavour options and some specials like donut holes, apple fritters and cinnamon buns. They don’t serve any drinks whatsoever, not even water, which I found odd but I also get it because it keeps inventory costs low. Maybe as the business grows they could add in coffees, hot chocolates etc. to accompany the donuts.

The menu design could use some work especially since there’s always a change given what filling/glaze/topping is available on a given day. They could probably just design one solid menu and you’re told upon ordering whether your choice of filling is available or not. The constant relabeling method they have currently just makes it look confusing.

That aside - we were excited to try a couple of different flavours. One donut goes for KSH400 and an assorted box of 9 goes for KSH2000. When you make your order, they have you fill out a sheet with your name, # of donuts, and choice of filling, glaze etc. Our order was as follows:

**Donut 1**: vanilla custard filling, original glaze, raspberry drizzle<br>
**Donut 2**: cookies and cream filling, cinnamon sugar glaze, passion drizzle, Oreo topping<br>
**Donut 3**: mocha filling, white chocolate glaze, raspberry drizzle, rainbow sprinkles topping<br>
**Donut 4**: passion filling, milk chocolate glaze, no drizzle, Oreo topping<br>

Donut 1 with original glaze, raspberry drizzle & vanilla custard filling was great! Zero notes on that one. Donut 2 with the cinnamon sugar glaze, etc… I had many notes. I couldn’t taste any cinnamon from the cinnamon sugar glaze. The passion drizzle is good but was slightly overpowered by the cookies & cream filling. This filling was also a bit much for me - it tasted like ice-cream in the donut and the lactose intolerant in me cried. This flavour combo was not the one.

Donut 3 with the mocha filling… that mocha was giving me life😋 The raspberry drizzle helped balance out the white chocolate glaze, without it, it would be too much chocolate given how sweet white chocolate is.

Donut 4 with the passion cream filling - this was my absolute fave! Everything about this combo was perfect, that passion filling particularly was just the right amount of tart to mix in with the milk chocolate glaze and a nice crunch from the Oreos… so good.

The donuts themselves are really fluffy and soft which I loved. I really don’t like thick donuts that aren’t soft because that’s way too much dough to chew on. Nick’s donuts are nice and airy, the fillings give the donut an elevated taste but I know even as a plain donut they’ll taste so good.

I’m glad I got to try these donuts because after my first try I really became obsessed! Thankfully both locations are quite far from me so I can’t easily just pop in and I know I can order online but I’ve managed to avoid it so far. I only remember to get some when I’m in the lavington or Gigiri area - if I don’t restrict myself I’d be having donuts every week🤭

They’re very good but also quite sweet so if you’re not a sweet tooth, you may not see the fuss but for others like me… these donuts can fix a sugar craving any day. So good!
