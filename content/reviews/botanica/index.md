Botanica is located at One Place Africa, Westlands. They used to be Honey & Dough prior to this rebrand. I feel like they’re going for a more gastro/fine dining route & it’s working for them from the experience we had here.

They have quite a vibrant menu. I had the chicken curry bao buns as a starter while my lovely date had the duck breast carpaccio. For mains I had the fish & chips, and my friend had the Nasi Goreng. For dessert, they made her a special not for carrot cake plate for her birthday while I had the Latte sundae:)

Out of all these - I loved the steamed buns so much! That chicken curry was spiced perfectly and the whole bun wasn’t too dry because some places really get bao buns wrong. The fish & chips was good too, the batter thankfully was not too thick.

The latte sundae is coffee flavoured and has bits of chocolate cake in it, coffee ice cream and some kind of mousse, really good. The prices are a tad steep - mains range from KSH1800-3500, starters are all over KSH1000 and desserts range from KSH700-900. The service was really great, they did change up the decor just a bit but it still looks very much like the former honey & dough (I love the decor).

They did up our table for my girl’s birthday so well people thought there was a proposal coming. She really enjoyed the cocktails and her birthday dessert that you can see in the images below.
