So I’m probably gonna sound biased but I truly feel like this is one of the best places for a good rich southern style brunch in New York. It’s one of my faves, and I always have to come here anytime I’m in this city and it never ever disappoints be it dine in or takeout👌🏾

So - context, Sweet Chick is a restaurant owned by Nas… yes that Nas. There are various locations in New York, Los Angeles and London too. They’re popular for their chicken and waffles and if you know me - you know I love a good chicken & waffle combo😋

This is a place that doesn’t do too much on decor, it’s simple and casual. Their playlist is fantastic - smooth R&B all through. I came here for brunch with some friends and everyone tried something different so we could all try each others food as friends do.

I had the classic chicken & waffles ($16). You can choose the chicken flavour (bbq, lemon pepper, honey garlic etc) for an additional $2 and you can choose a speciality waffle (apple cinnamon, bacon cheddar, chocolate chip or vanilla glaze) for $2 extra too. Highly recommend the apple cinnamon and the bacon cheddar waffle.

I talk about waffles on here a lot because it’s so hard to find a good fluffy yet airy waffle! These waffles hit the mark completely. They’re not too doughy, nice and fluffy, a little crispy on the outside and that powdered sugar on top is the cherry on top.

The chicken you guys… good southern fried chicken is where it’s at! I can’t describe it any better honestly - so crisp, so moist and so much flavour! The pieces are a healthy size too - because America will feed you lol, so two pieces was too much for me to finish. The meal comes with maple syrup and their specialty butters - the raspberry one is a fave.

We also had some loaded fries ($10, these were okay, I’m not a big fan of loaded fries so I’m not the best to judge on this) and I tried my friend’s lemon pepper chicken sandwich - bomb!

Honestly - everything I had here was so good as always, I have no complaints about the food at all. The service is really great, I can’t remember our server’s name but he’s Ghanaian and you know it’s a party when all the Africans come together. He was very gracious and made sure to recommend the best drinks that the rest of the table really enjoyed.

A perfect place for brunch, or late lunch/early dinner, casual happy hour too. If you’re ever in NY, or LA or London - you have to try some Sweet Chick chicken & waffles, that food is good for your soul. Their motto is literally - Have Fun. Eat Well. Spread Love 😀
