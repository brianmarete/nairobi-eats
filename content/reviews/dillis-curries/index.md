My love for butter chicken has no bounds and Ando Foods get it right every time. Butter chicken is and will forever be a fave! The Palak Paneer was a first for me to try this year & the lactose intolerant in me persevered & survived.

I also tried the Chicken Masala curry - didn’t enjoy that one as much as the butter chicken but it wasn’t bad. The curries come with freshly buttered Naan or garlic Naan. Single portions - KSH950/ and Double portions - KSH1750/

They have some very heavenly fresh orange juice which I don’t have a picture of but trust me when I say… you wanna add that OJ to your order.
