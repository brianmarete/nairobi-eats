I’ve been here a few times and I always have a fabulous time. The food y’all... the food is so good! The owner told us to try a little bit of everything so we went for the platter which includes BBQ ribs, jerk chicken, lamb sausages, osso bucco, rice and beans, plantains, sweet potatoes, red slaw and grilled veggies.

That was a mouthful to write so you can guess it was a mouthful to eat as well.

They pride themselves with not frying anything - everything is grilled/roasted or stewed (minus chips). I missed out on the goat curry because it was sold out and of course you can’t have Jamaican food without some rum infused cocktails!

It’s located at the Gigiri Craft Centre which is quite a nice hangout spot with other cool restaurants within it like Solo Grano, The Daily Cafe, Shokudo, there’s a gelato place and a nice bakery with really bomb focaccia bread.

I would highly recommend checking this place out and I suggest you try some fall off the bone osso bucco & super tasty jerk chicken to start with + their hibiscus sorrel.
