Joto Ramen is the new kid on the block in regards to Ramen spots and I was glad when they finally got a standalone location at the Alchemist because I kept missing their pop-ups! Also, I did not know the alchemist had that much space because Joto Ramen is quite spacious - it opens out at the back of alchemist with lots of seating and the floating red lanterns create a fun vibe be it day or night.

I came here for lunch with a friend and we got started with some fresh edamame (KSH398). There’s nothing special to edamame, it’s just a nice healthy snack to have as you wait for the main meal. For starters we had the karaage (Japanese style fried chicken - KSH698), it was very crispy and very tasty! It was accompanied with some mayo and chilli sauce which made perfect dippings.

For the mains we had the shoyu ramen (KSH1850) which is their main special ramen. What I like about their ramen options here is that you can add whatever toppings you’d like (at an extra cost of course) on top of whatever is in the ramen already.

I think I only added extra seaweed because I love seaweed (weird I know but try it and thank me later😅). I actually enjoyed this ramen. Was it the best ramen I’ve ever had? No. But was it awful? Not at all. Would I have it again? Yes. The broth was full of flavour and the pork belly was cooked well. I think it’s the noodles that didn’t hit the mark for me. They make their own noodles which is dope, I probably should have chosen a different type of noodle but other than that, the whole meal was really good.

We weren’t gonna try dessert but they had an ice cream offer that day - for every KSH1000 spent you get a free scoop of ice cream, who am I to say no to free ice cream?🙃 We tried the matcha and salted caramel ice cream. Surprisingly I loved the matcha ice cream, it doesn’t taste like grass! And it paired well with the salted caramel👌🏾

Service here was okay - the place wasn’t packed so the wait time wasn’t too long for anything. One thing I noticed is that you can’t order drinks from them, you have to order from Alchemist - which was frustrating because the alchemist staff are not on that side much so getting a drink order took longer than it should have - they need to work on that.

Other than that, I think Joto ramen is quite a nice place. I love a good ramen spot and I’m glad that more places like these are opening up here. Perfect for lunch or dinner with a group, a date or solo.
