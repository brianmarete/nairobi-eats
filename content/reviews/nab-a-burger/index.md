I’ve been wanting to visit this place for a very long time and planning for lunch here took an even longer time because aligning schedules with three other adults is an extreme sport. The popular Nab A Burger is located in the Office park complex in Riverside.

I thought it was a sit down restaurant but I was pleasantly surprised to see that it’s actually a food truck with a section of Office park’s compound used as seating space.

The menu is vibrant with specialised burgers with punny names like Tree Haga and What’s Gonion😄 Our orders included the Double Joe’s burger (KSH1700/), Baby got Bac(on) (KSH900/), Chick Chikalo (KSH950/) and a side order of chicken strips (KSH500/). All these were accompanied with some freshly seasoned fries.

The Double Joe’s burger looked so inviting! The cheese had melted perfectly on both patties, the bacon was both soft & crispy, and everything together looked so sumptuous. When I tasted it though… I was a bit taken aback… it didn’t taste as great as it looked. The whole combo was great but the patty was letting me down. It was thick, the meat was not soft, barely any flavour. I figured maybe it was just that one. The baby got bac(on) was my order and even that one wasn’t giving. The bacon did not disappoint because bacon can never let me down but that beef patty was not cooked well. No flavour at all, tasted bland and felt like it was just popped out from the freezer onto the grill but they didn’t let it cook through properly. So disappointing for a burger that looks so good.

The chick chikalo redeemed its counterparts thankfully. As you know, I’m not one to order a chicken burger but this one…?? I HIGHLY recommend. This burger had crispy southern fried chicken, cheese, coleslaw, and a nice spread of a very tasty sriracha mayo😋 The crunch & the moistness of the chicken, the freshness of the slaw and the kick of spice from the sriracha mayo altogether was a party in my mouth. That was a damn good burger. Loved it so much I had to have the chicken again hence the order of chicken strips🙈 These also did not disappoint at all:)

They were also in the middle of renovating the seating space when we went, so can’t say much about the ambience during that time but service was good, no complaints there. I like that it’s an outdoor setting so you’re not confined to buildings or malls, and I think they’re done with the renovations now meaning the garden area setup must be quite enjoyable on sunny afternoons and cozy in the evenings.

I’m not sure what went wrong with the beef burgers. Maybe it was just not a good day for them because I’ve only heard great things about the burgers here. I’ll give them another try when I’m in riverside next, but I hope they’ll let the patty cook properly next time.
