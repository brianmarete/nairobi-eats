Last but not least on the [#watamueats](/tags/watamueats/) series is Seafood Cafe. This roadside cafe is quite easy to find, it’s right by the main Watamu sign on Gede Road. It’s a simple restaurant with very little thought to decor and ambience though I did appreciate the graffiti murals on the walls. The place gives very much kibanda-esque vibes which I was happy because that means the food will be excellent

The menu isn’t giving kibanda though because prawn curry ya 1800/ is def not a usual menu item. What I came for was some tasty Swahili food and according to a friend who recommended this place, theirs is top notch

I ordered some passion juice (KSH200) and some fish samosas to start with (KSH200). The passion juice was just what I needed for such a hot day, super refreshing and super fresh. It has hints of tamarind in it which really elevated the taste

The fish samosas were just there. I was hoping they’d taste as good as some I had in Lamu some time back but they really fell flat… also I think I just don’t like the taste of minced fish, adding lime to it helped a lot

My main order was the chicken biryani (KSH750) which really hit the spot! So rich in flavour, so tasty and so filling. There’s nothing like having a good biryani dish with some ukwaju at the coast, truly nothing at all The only thing left was a dip in the ocean which I promptly did after this meal and my day was complete.

If you’re ever in Watamu and craving some Swahili cuisine, checkout seafood cafe for a traditional coastal breakfast or for some snacks or for a hot lunch and breezy dinner when the sun is down. Try that passion tamarind juice too and thank me later
