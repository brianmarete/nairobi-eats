We are in Spring valley today talking about Sugar Bowl - a very cute restaurant with a great menu to match. The decor is nice and simple and minimalist but also elegant - the warm lighting in various pockets of the restaurant particularly really caught my eye. Great lighting really makes or breaks a place. They have an upper and lower section with outside seating as well on both sections.

I like that the menu is vast but doesn’t feel vast with the way it’s designed. It has a little bit of everything from breakfast, to lunch or dinner. I’ve been here a few times so let me share what I’ve tried so far: fried chicken burger (KSH1,200), caprese sandwich (KSH900), chicken Alfredo pasta (KSH1250), samosas (KSH600) tiramisu (KSH550), New York cheesecake (KSH650), salted caramel cake (KSH500), and eclairs (KSH500 each).

I have to start by saying their pineapple mint juice is so refreshing! Perfect on a nice sunny day or a warm evening. I really wanted to try the butterscotch latte but they never seem to have it available.

The caprese sandwich tasted very fresh and delicious, the pesto in it added a nice kick! The chicken burger wasn’t too great. The chicken was over fried which took away from the taste of the overall burger. Loved the burger buns though, nice and buttery😋 The beef samosas were really good! Nice and crispy on the outside, the mince inside wasn’t dry and had just the right amount of salt, and 4 samosas was a good portion for a starter.

The chicken Alfredo was also served in a great portion. It tasted sublime! The cream used was amazing, heavy but not nauseatingly creamy… even for my lactose intolerance… I really ate the whole bowl clean! So so good. The chicken pieces are plentiful and also very flavourful… I added some fresh chillies for a kick of spice and this resulted to a beautiful medley of flavour in my mouth😋

Desserts: I stop by here for a different piece of cake everytime I’m in the spring valley area because after I tried one of their cakes… I said I have to try more. They haven’t disappointed me yet! The tiramisu was really good, fresh, the cream was light and fluffy with plenty of coffee powder on top for us who love the coffee part of tiramisu😊

The New York cheesecake is a classic cheesecake that not many people make well - the sugar bowl team however have perfected it. I would have liked the crust to be more crumbly and less soft but still - I’m not mad at it. The Salted caramel cake is not deathly sweet thank goodness. I love the layering within the cake, I did not love the gelatine-like top.. the caramel taste from the gelatine felt like an aftertaste. The frosting in the layers is perfectly balanced and it doesn’t have that annoying plain butter taste👌🏾

The Vanilla eclair was nice and sweet, a bit too soft but a good eclair nonetheless. The Tiramisu eclair had nothing tiramisu-y about it. It was also way too soft and had too much cream - I think they should scrap that as an option and just keep the vanilla and chocolate options.

The service here is good, can’t complain much about it - the servers were attentive and offered good suggestions when I couldn’t make a decision on what to order. Shoutout to my friend Jayson by the way, he’s the one who influenced me to get the cheesecake when I saw him try it a while back, great choice!

I quite like this place - it’s also near my Physiotherapist which explains why I was there so often😅 It’s a nice place for a breakfast/brunch plan, evening coffee dates or catch ups or weekend lunch/dinner plans.
