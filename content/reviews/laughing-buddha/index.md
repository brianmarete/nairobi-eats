The Laughing Buddha is located in Kenrail towers ground floor and is also at the Sarit Centre - the new wing. It is fully vegetarian - which surprisingly I didn’t mind. I had a cute pink latte called the rose cardamom latte, some peri peri fries and the paneer bao buns. The latte was so cute but a little too sweet for my liking, though the cardamom really hit the spot!

The fries were perfect and the buns were also really good, spicy and filling! They also have nuts which adds a nice crunch to the whole meal. We were too full to try their many dessert options though I plan to go back and try their sizzling brownie which seems to be very popular there because almost every table had ordered one.
