So I‚Äôm a tea girl through and through but over the years I‚Äôve really come to love a good cup of coffee, and not just any coffee, really good coffee. Spring Valley Coffee is probably one of the best coffee brands in Kenya & a personal fave! So when I heard that they had a cafe, of course I had to check it out.

The cafe is located in the Lavington Business Hub just opposite Lavington Green. It‚Äôs a quaint space with minimalist decor, earthy tones and very muted colours outside of the two very vibrant paintings on the wall which bring in a nice splash of colour to place.

It‚Äôs giving exactly what a coffee shop needs to give - small but functional. I think if the place was to fill up it would have about 15 people max. It‚Äôs not a place that you can come for lunch or dinner but it‚Äôs definitely a place you can stop by to pick up a coffee & a pastry or have a quick meeting or early breakfast date with someone.

What I wasn‚Äôt a fan of though were the seats - the stools were quite small and with their wooden base, those may not be as comfortable to sit in for a long period of time - maybe that‚Äôs the point? Not sure. Even the wooden bench along the wall, very well designed but sure to have you sore after a while so they do need some cushions or something which‚Ä¶ UPDATE (they now have cushions yay!).

Their menu is also just as brief but also functional. They have of course an array of coffees, teas, they even have frappes (I‚Äôll try that next time) and they have a nice selection of pastries, donuts, croissants and pies.

I came here with another coffee enthusiast for breakfast and we decided to try a few pastries and we had a mocha (KSH380/) and a Zanzibar latte (KSH380/). The pastries of choice were the chocolate croissant (KSH270/) the cheese twist (KSH320/) and the spinach ricotta pastry (KSH320/).

That Zanzibar latte was immaculately good! A latte is a latte you know, but if you make it a balanced mix of espresso, milk and add a touch of tea masala spice and add cinnamon on top - that‚Äôs a good latte. Savoured it till the end.

Of the pastries we had my favourite was the spinach ricotta which surprised me because ricotta cheese isn‚Äôt something I gravitate towards but the blend of the cheese and spinach and the buttery goodness of the puff pastry made the whole thing come together beautifully and we can say it‚Äôs healthy because of spinach right?üôÉ Def something I‚Äôd have again and again. Our server suggested adding some of their homemade chilli to it and that really took the taste up several notches, so good!

This cafe would be a perfect working spot for me if I lived closer to their location. It‚Äôs never packed, strong wifi, great coffee and enough pastries and snacks to keep you going. They also sell all manner of coffee paraphernalia here so if you‚Äôre thinking of trying out brewing coffee on your own, I‚Äôd suggest getting the tools here and getting advice on what type of coffee works best for what machine.
