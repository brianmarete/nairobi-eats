I saw a reel somewhere that said Nairobi is being dominated by 3 things: Matcha, Padel and that run club They’re not wrong! If you haven’t tried the very famous Karak & Go vanilla Matcha latte then I applaud you for not giving into peer pressure. But also - where are you hiding?

Personally - I tried the matcha, I didn’t like it at all. The milk is way too much for me and the only thing that makes that drink palatable is the vanilla syrup they add to it. Matcha on its own definitely tastes like cut grass - very bland so that vanilla is possibly why a lot of you like it. Try matcha on its own then get back to me lol. I do appreciate that they don’t skimp on the matcha though, they put in a good amount which is probably why it costs so much - 690/ for a singular non-alcoholic drink is wild.

What I do love from here though is the iced brown sugar shaken espresso though… so amazing! It’s not too sweet, it’s not bitter, has the right amount of coffee and the right amount of brown sugar syrup - so good! It’s been my addiction for months now and I make it a point to have it at least once a week if possible. Currently on a caffeine break for lent and I’m really struggling… T minus 1.5months until we are reunited sigh.

The sandwiches here were great but they lacked the spiciness the servers claimed they had. Kenyans need to stop saying something is spicy when it’s really not. It’s okay, some of us actually like spicy things so don’t lie to us please.

For some reason they never seem to have power on a Saturday which affects the coffee making process for the iced brown sugar espresso - but does not affect the matcha process so I’m the only one who lucks out on weekends here lol

Karak & Go is quite a small space - can fit maybe a max of 8 people at a go, which is probably why it’s called Karak AND Go lol, it’s primarily meant to just be a pick up point. I hope they can expand to a bigger space soon due to their popularity, and it would be nice to be able to meet up for coffee and sit and chill there instead of in the car in their parking lot.

Love their branding - especially their use of fun stickers, the stationery girlies like me love a good sticker and it just adds to the fun of the drink. It also helps their marketing because the stickers are of popular phrases that everyone wants to be associated with so they know anyone with a matcha latte or espresso latte will snap a pic & post to show that they’re ’just a girl’

For the coffee lovers I’d recommend the brown sugar shaken espresso iced latte, for the vanilla lovers, the matcha vanilla latte will do you good, for the real matcha lovers - this may not hit the spot as such due to all the sugar but it’s a nice twist to the traditional matcha to try
