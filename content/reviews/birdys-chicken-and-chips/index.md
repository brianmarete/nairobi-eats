I had the pleasure of trying out Birdy's Chicken & Chips a while back and I’m here to tell the tale 😊 Birdys is a vibrant chicken and chips shop tucked away in a nice corner of the Parklands area.

I love their very bright yellow theme running throughout the restaurant, it really makes it stand out. I came here for lunch with my girlies and we tried a few things from their nice succinct menu: Chilli mango cheese burger (KSH400), fried quarter chicken & chips (KSH300), quarter poussin chicken & chips (KSH350), corn ribs (KSH250), an Oreo milkshake (KSH400) and passion and strawberry lemonades (KSH250).

The corn ribs were just okay. The chilli mango cheese burger was a nice portion and quite delicious. The chilli mango sauce they put in it was the star of the show! I don’t know how she makes that sauce but I had it with everything and carried some tubs takeaway - it needs to be bottled and sold to the masses 👌🏾

The fried chicken was well done and well marinated and they gave a nice portion of fries for that price. The poussin chicken wasn’t as spicy as poussin usually is, not sure why plus I found it way too oily… that was my least favourite thing here.

The milkshake was just okay, not as thick as one would like but had a nice rich Oreo ice-cream taste. The lemonades were super refreshing, especially the passion, very well made.

I like that this place is just an around the corner type joint but they’ve outfitted it well enough to give a more visually appealing feel to it. The prices are fantastic! Super affordable and perfect for that nice pick me up on a Saturday evening if you don’t wanna cook or a nice casual lunch plan after a game of padel because I saw a padel place right by it 😉

If you’re ever in the parklands area, check it out and lemme know your thoughts!
