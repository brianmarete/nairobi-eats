If there’s one thing Ando Foods guys get right every time other than their food, it’s the packaging. With this brand - they were going for a classic American diner look with the red+white, the branded buns & checkered wrapping paper - love it.

I have had Cheeseburger (KSH900/) & the hot Chik’n burger (KSH850/). The Fries are sold separately at KSH150/. The Cheeseburger was okay, the portion is great, I just wish the patty had more flavour? The brioche buns are perfectly toasted and the fries are good too. But yeah, the beef patty was a tad bland.

The Hot Chik’n burger was amazing! It’s a breaded chicken breast, topped with coleslaw and pickles etc. It’s spicy and so flavourful and I’m ready for another one soon.
