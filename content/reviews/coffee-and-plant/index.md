Coffee & Plant is a nice vibrant cafe located along General Mathenge Road in Westlands. Randomly stumbled upon their page on Instagram and said I had to go check it out particularly because they specialise in plant based cuisine and a fusion of specialty coffee. I also originally thought they sell plants too due to the name but I was immediately corrected once I got there.

The restaurant is big and I love that it has both an indoor and outdoor section by the terrace. The decor is very minimalist and the natural light makes the place look very welcoming. The menu has a little bit of everything and please note everything here is vegetarian, plant based or vegan aka there are no meat dishes here whatsoever and I actually appreciated that. Vegetarians and vegans really get the short end of the stick in restaurants in Nairobi so it’s nice to see places coming up with niche menus that cater to this preference.

We tried the coffee bean cookie milkshake (KSH650), the ground coffee and miso chocolate chip cookie (KSH250), the french toast sandwich (KSH1350) and the spinach feta wrap (KSH1350).

The coffee bean cookie milkshake was not as thick as I’d have liked but it was still really tasty, their coffee is so bomb. The ground coffee & miso chocolate chip cookie was an interesting combo of ingredients for a cookie, you could definitely taste the coffee and chocolate flavours, and I could tell the miso taste as an after taste, adding a nice savouriness to the sweetness of the chocolate.

The French toast sandwich looked amazing! It’s French toast filled with cheddar cheese, coriander, pickles, chilli oil and comes with a side salad (loved the little shredded pesto apple sticks on the salad) The cheese is plant based and this slightly took away from the taste I expected as a cheese lover… I could definitely taste the plant lol, but all in all still a good sandwich once your taste buds adjust to the cheddar taste.

The spinach feta wrap was very delicious! I don’t like that they didn’t use an actual wrap and used chapati instead but I’ll let that slide for today… because it was very tasty especially paired with that tzatziki dip and the side salad with the shredded pesto apple strips. So good! They used normal dairy feta cheese for this dish (is that why I liked it so much??) and you can’t go wrong with a feta and spinach combo.

Vegetarian/vegan food doesn’t have to be bland and boring and I think Coffee & Plant have really nailed that in their creative dishes and beverages. This is a perfect place to bring any of your vegetarian/vegan friends and yourself as well if you’re curious enough to expand your palate or if you’re looking to try more plant-based meals.

Not everyday kanyama pls, its actually not even healthy to have red meat daily so try this place one of these days for your coffee dates and lunch plans and thank me later.
