Talking burgers today🍔 Smash Burgers opened shop a few months ago and judging from the public response - they’ve been quite a smash hit😉

Smash Burgers is under the same brand as [Crispy Chick]({{<relref "/crispy-chick">}}) and [Ayeyo]({{<relref "/ayeyo">}}) so you already know it’s a cloud kitchen restaurant i.e. delivery only. I have a thing about how burgers and pasta travel during delivery and so I tend not to order those often.

But in the name of trying new things, I gave smash burgers a try. I first tried the solo supreme burger (KSH1050). It has a single patty, cheese, pickles, caramelised onions and their signature smash sauce. The burgers all come with your choice of fries - plain, tangy, or cajun.

Their packaging is perfect! Especially for transporting burgers - the burger is packed separately so that it doesn’t move too much and retains its structure which I really appreciate. The fries were a good portion but found the plain version a bit oily. The burger buns on the solo burger were a bit thin, thought they’d be thicker but they didn’t taste bad at all as they are brioche buns. The patty was juicy but felt like it needed a bit more salt - if there were no pickles, onions etc., I think it would taste quite bland.

On my next try - I had the double up supreme burger (KSH1250) and chose tangy fries this time. This was a much bigger cheeseburger due to the double patties and I guess they heard me talk about salt from my house because this burger patty was a lot more flavourful even without the extra toppings and definitely more filling. The tangy fries were perfect, not oily at all.

My last try which just happens to be my favourite of the bunch was the double Chilli Supreme Delight burger (KSH1300) with cajun fries. As the name suggests, it’s a chilli cheese burger with a double patty and double cheese but with an addition of jalapeños and red chilli peppers. This burger is so good! The chilli brings out a nice burst of spice that balances perfectly with the rest of the burger especially the mix of that with the sweetness of the caramelised onions… chef’s kiss!

The Cajun fries are also my favourite of their three options, so yummy and so well spiced that you can have them without ketchup.

One random day at work I ordered the classic crispy wings (KSH600) because I wasn’t hungry enough for a burger - the wings are 6 in a pack and a good size, not tiny thankfully! They are perfectly crispy, so crispy I think they’d win over KFC in a crispy competition lol. The batter they used could use a bit more salt though (do I just take too much salt?🙈😅) but the crispyness def needed something to give it some flavour - the chicken itself is juicy, well cooked and the accompanying sauce (not sure what it is, but has a mayo consistency) was a really yummy pairing to the wings👌🏾

If I was to recommend a meal from smash burgers, it would be the double chilli supreme burger with Cajun fries and a cold coke to wash it down🤤

They have their own app that you can order from - Food Dash (I know I know… not another app🫠) but it’s actually worth using because they have great lunch offers during the week and I’ve found they’re slightly cheaper to order from than UberEats and Bolt Foods. They just need to work on their delivery times, it can be slow at times.

The brand umbrella of Ayeyo, Crispy Chick and now Supreme Smash burgers has really expanded fast. I hope they’re able to keep it up because so far they’re doing quite well in regards to food quality. Looking forward to whatever they have coming next😊
