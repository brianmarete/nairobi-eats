On the very first day landing in Negril we were famished and luckily this place was very close to our hotel - literally a 5 minute walk. It was also one of the places I had noted down while doing research for this trip as it came highly recommended in many travel groups.

Best in the West can be described as a street food restaurant that is right by the roadside along Negril’s Norman Manley Boulevard. Decor is very simple and there’s always reggae music playing.

The menu is just as simple, offering classic Jamaican dishes. Best in the West is best known for the authentic street style jerk chicken and curry goat. We all had jerk chicken ($15) with rice & peas of course except one friend who had oxtail ($25) instead.

Everything was 10/10 across the board. That chicken - soft, moist, grilled to perfection. Was it as spicy as I’d like? Not so much but it’s definitely #2 in my list of best jerk chicken I’ve had in Jamaica - the Pelican Grill’s one being my #1:)

I had a super delish virgin strawberry daiquiri ($8) (first of many😅) and really just enjoyed the vibes here. Sitting by the road with friends under the warm evening sun eating jerk chicken listening to reggae in Negril is the exact vibe I expected in Jamaica.

Service was good, and if it wasn’t for the fact that we wanted to sherehe, we’d have chilled there for most of the night. If you’re ever in Negril, check out Best in the West, there’s a reason that’s their name😉
