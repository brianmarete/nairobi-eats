I visited their Hurlingham branch at Doctor’s Plaza but they also have branches in Gigiri at the Gigiri Craft Centre and at  Sarit Centre. It’s a really cute spot, their decor is A1. They have quite an extensive menu, with breakfast all day! I had waffles and a side of bacon, which came with some fruit & way too little whipped cream… why was it just a drop of cream?? I liked my meal but would have liked a better serving of whipped cream.

My friend had the King breakfast that was a full plate of mushrooms, an omelette, baked beans, sausage, bacon, buttermilk pancakes… I’ve probably forgotten something because there was a lot of stuff on that plate. I also got the blueberry cheesecake for dessert which I really inhaled the next day because I was too full to have it on that day, it was so good!

What I loved the most though… their cinnamon dolce latte with turmeric spice. I was sceptical of it at first because - turmeric… but I tasted it and really gulped it down, I wanted another one asap! That was a really good latte, every time I go to a Daily Cafe that’s the first thing I order.

General overview: great place, yummy food, I don’t like that this particular branch is in a hospital complex but I did go back with another friend & ate the exact same things so maybe the location isn’t so bad after all. I’m willing to go back to try their main lunch/dinner menu.
