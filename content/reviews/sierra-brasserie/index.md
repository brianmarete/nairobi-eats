Sierra has maintained their quality of food, service & ambience for years and I really appreciate that about them. The balcony area is really my favourite place to sit!

I only come here for two things - their very sumptuous burgers and their dessert. Before they changed their menu they used to have this truffle mushroom burger that was the bees knees of burgers! I don’t know why they removed it and I hope they see this review and bring it back please.

So due to the lack of said mushroom burger, I now always get the bacon & cheese burger (KSH1500), their yummy cream spinach & chips because waru is life:) This burger guys… that wagyu x boran beef combo is perfection.

For starters I’ve only tried their chicken wings (KSH1050) and some potato croquettes they used to have but are no longer on the menu. The wings are a tad salty but the sauce they’re doused in is nice and sweet.

Let me take a break here and talk about the aesthetic of the place for a bit. Sierra is well fitted for fine dining & they’ve made it their business to provide perfect mood lighting, music and semi-secluded seating, perfect for dates, groups dates, business meetings etc.

Okay back to the food and to the main reason I always go back to Sierra - DESSERT. I’m a sweet tooth and there’s one dish that has had me in a chokehold for years - the Sierra sticky toffee pudding. It may look small but the flavours pack a big punch!

It’s such a simple dish of toffee pudding, infused with rum, vanilla, drizzled with caramel sauce + a single scoop of vanilla ice cream. So simple but I love it so much! Topped off with a hard candy sculpture that’s probably the cause of many cavities in my life but life is short.

I remember when it used to cost KSH550… now thanks to this hideous economy it’s at KSH900 so I can't have it as often as I’d like. I highly recommend this as a dessert option, I have never tried anything else on their dessert menu but for those who like options, the menu is included in the gallery below.

Sierra is also a popular place for steaks. I’m not a steak person as such but I always hear nothing but good things about the steak here. Sierra also branched out and opened a sister restaurant called FNKY BRGR. I haven’t tried anything here but haven’t heard anything bad about it either. You can get FNKY BRGR menu items in the main Sierra restaurants as well.

Overall thoughts: I’ve always loved Sierra, I still love it to this day - it’s always gonna be on my list of places to eat in Nairobi to recommend.
