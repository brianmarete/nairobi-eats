Yunion is a brunch cafe and bar located at the GTC building in Westlands. It has a nice set up with both an indoor and outdoor section, outfitted very nicely, lots of greenery, lots of warm lighting - they also have a dinosaur statue outside which I found quite odd given their decor but I assume it has a purposeüòÑ

Came here for an early brunch. Their menu seems to be a mix of Asian dishes, some continental dishes and Italian. I opted to try the southern comfort (KSH1200) meal from their brunch menu and my friend had the shakshuka (KSH1200). I also wanted some fresh orange juice to go with it as it was a nice sunny day but they didn‚Äôt have any juice.

The southern comfort is a chicken and waffles dish and is usually quite a heavy meal given the portions but this one was quite the opposite. The waffles were quite thin in size and thick in taste - way too much dough. The southern fried chicken‚Ä¶ was just thin strips of chicken?? Literally just 4 strips to fit the 4 waffles pieces‚Ä¶ barely coated or crispy and probably over cooked given how dry they tasted. The honey meant to accompany the dish was annoyingly sweet, probably mixed with sugar - which defeats the purpose of using honey in the first place.

The shakshuka was good, and it came with buttered toast. The eggs could have been softer, but overall not a bad meal.

Since my first choice was disappointing and I clearly wasn‚Äôt going to finish it, I opted to get some lemon pepper wings to quell my hunger - I should have just stayed hungryü´† Those wings were a no‚Ä¶ not tasty at all.

Me and my bad choices just drank my coffee and called it a day. The service though I must say was good, the waitress really sympathised with me and offered other alternatives to remedy the situation but I was over it by then - if 2 dishes out of 3 from your menu are not worth finishing I don‚Äôt think it would be wise to order something else.

Yunion seems to be a hit for vibes and drinks as they have all day brunch on Sundays and lots of events throughout the week. When it comes to food though, I‚Äôd not recommend it.
