I’ve been to Hero a couple of times between last year & this year & always had a fantastic time there. The food was great, the service was on point and the place just has great vibes! I had prawn tempura (quite large ones) which I felt had way too much batter tempura wise but all in all a good fleshy prawn on the inside.

I also had some very soft, flavourful lamb chops that was paired with a tangy sauce and some fries:) I know it’s a sushi place but I don’t eat sushi so I didn't try any but my friend did and he absolutely loved it. Can’t remember the name of the roll but it had papaya in it and the theatrical presentation was it!

Tried one of their many homemade ice creams for dessert - the roasted maize ice cream which literally tastes like mahindi ya barabara with a touch of cayenne that surprises you at the end of every spoonful. Love this ice cream!

I really like that the waiter serving your table signs and gives you a postcard with a superhero on the cover, again nice touch:) Reagan was such a delight, I don’t know if he’s still there but if he is say hi if you see him!

The prices are quite steep though. Don’t go there on a whim please lol, go prepared with money to spend, the cheapest thing there is probably the aji garlic fries that go for KSH500/. On my last visit here a few months ago, I tried their crispy chicken Bao buns and the rest of the party had sushi… the Bao buns were too dry for my liking. Made up for it with that yummy ice cream for dessert again.

Overall Hero is a fun culinary experience, I would love to go back and try more of their menu items:) To note - they also serve Vegan dishes for those looking for vegan friendly restaurants.
