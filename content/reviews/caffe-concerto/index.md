Ciao from Caffe Concerto, a super cozy and quaint Italian restaurant located in the heart of Kilimani. It’s a house turned restaurant that serves up a variety of authentic Italian meals made with traditional ingredients and a touch of that homemade goodness we all know and love from our own home cooked meals.

The restaurant isn’t as spacious and I think that’s what I really like about it. A few tables here and there, perfect setup for dinners for two at the most maybe four. I’ve been a fan of caffe concerto for many years and even though I don’t frequent it as often as I used to, any small chance I get to visit and have some freshly made pasta I’d never pass up.

Like this last visit when I went to lunch with a dear friend The menu is very typically Italian, you have your appetizers, salads, pastas, pizza and continental mains & of course traditional Italian desserts like tiramisu and the like.

We had the Greek salad (KSH910) to start, lasagne (KSH1450) and prosciutto funghi pizza (KSH1400) for the mains and a tiramisu for dessert (KSH750).

The Greek salad was so simple and yet so good! I love a good Greek salad - that feta and olive oil combo really does something to my taste buds. Yes I did have the avocado removed because this is who I am as a person don’t judge me please and thanks. Also the olives.

The lasagne was very cheesy, nice and creamy, oozing fresh minced beef with a sprinkle of chilli flakes on top??… that’s that typa meal that will definitely clog your arteries but it’s worth every bite.

The prosciutto & funghi pizza (ham & mushroom) is usually my go-to pizza flavour at any Italian spot. Unfortunately this one felt a bit overcooked this time, I think it stayed in the oven too long so the crust felt a bit hard. Not their best version but it must have been a bad day because the pizza is usually bomb!

Another recommendation that I did not have on this day but usually always do whenever I go there is their chicken & mushroom tagliatelle. Another very rich and creamy pasta dish that you can possibly only have once a quarter to save your waistline but the day you have it you’ll be rolling yourself home happy and ready for the best itis of your life So good!

The tiramisu is one that my friend would not approve of because of how creamy it is but that’s truly how tiramisu should be. Lots of cream layered over the soft lady fingers with that perfect lining of coffee powder on top - decadent!

Caffe Concerto has like 3 parking spots lol so please avoid driving there if you can. It’s a perfect place for a date night, the ambience is intimate enough without being too fancy. It’s also great for a nice late afternoon plan with your girls sipping wine over pasta and breadsticks catching up on each other's lives as the day whizzes by.

I really like Caffe Concerto and I’m glad it’s still in business so many years later knowing how fickle the restaurant scene in Nairobi is nowadays.
