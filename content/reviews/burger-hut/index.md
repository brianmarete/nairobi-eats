If this isn’t a blast from the past I don’t know what is😄 Did you guys ever go to Burger Hut back in the day?? Did you also know that Burger Hut has been in business since 1986?? This was a staple Sunday lunch joint in my childhood and then it disappeared from my life for a while until my 20s and since then, it’s always been one of my go to places for simple yet juicy burgers. They have since changed locations though, they are no longer on Mpaka Road but now at Muthithi Road in Westlands, at the shopping centre there.

They’ve tried to liven the space up a bit with the lighting and the graffiti on the walls but also people don’t really come here for the ambience so they don’t need to do too much to pull people in. Came by for a midweek dinner plan with a friend and we had the beef, bacon & cheese burger (KSH870/) and the double hut burger (KSH910/). Both of these come with fries, a small side salad and a soda. We also tried some masala fries because why not?

Why not should have been why did we…🫠 The masala fries were not giving at all. The essence of masala fries is the spicy kick you get from eating them but these were quite bland sadly. Their regular fries were great though.

The cheese burger was great as well, it’s a simple burger, well done patty, a slice of cheese on top and freshly fried bacon complete the look. Of course with your usual tomatoes and lettuce too plus their homemade mayonnaise sauce. Nothing fancy, nothing too over the top, nothing fancy about their burger buns either - simple and fresh and tasty. I ate the whole thing so quickly. I’m usually slow with burgers because of how big present day burgers have become lol.

The double hut burger was something I had never tried before and when it came I realised why it’s called the double hut… it has two burger top buns instead of just the one. It also has two beef patties and a slice of cheese at the very top. Personally that’s too much bread for me… the extra bun in the middle isn’t necessary - it could just be a double beef burger without the extra bun (which they also have) so I guess this one is an ode to the hut in their branding. The burger was much better without the extra bun in the middle.

The rest of the menu has a variety of different burgers (including vegetarian ones), they also serve chicken and fish. We were served by the kindest waiter, he feels very familiar, like he’s been working there from way back when but I could be wrong. He was very nice and attentive too.

I like this place for the nostalgia it brings. It’s probably one of the reasons the business is still running after all this time, it holds fond memories & makes for fun new ones. I think it’s a great place for a date especially because it’s never full. If you don’t want to meet everyone in Nairobi at dinner, go to Burger hut, low-key, chill, good food & affordable too. It’s also great for a quick lunchtime plan with colleagues, friends or solo and perfect for the kids on the weekends in the name of fresh fast food👌🏾
