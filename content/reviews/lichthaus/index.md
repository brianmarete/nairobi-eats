We are finally getting into the Watamu series! Starting the series with the very popular Lichthaus restaurant that is located by Mida Creek Watamu. We’ve all seen the nets, we’ve all wanted a picture while sitting on those nets, we’ve all wanted to watch the sunset while sipping cocktails on those nets… what we didn’t know was the process of getting on those nets…

We had just docked at Lichthaus after a wonderful dhow ride along Mida Creek so the vibes were high and everyone was excited to eat and drink. When walking in we were told we have to go back to the main entry to pay to enter - which I was like huh? But okay I guess. It’s KSH1000 to enter and that cost is redeemable at the bar at least. I guess this is also to keep out people who would just come for the sunset vibes and not purchase anything so kind of makes sense.

The place was already quite busy when we got there and we were a group of about 30 being added to the mix so you can imagine how packed it got. Anyway, because one net cannot fit all of us, the rest of us situated ourselves on some tables within the restaurant.

PS: You have to reserve a net and to do that you need to pay a KSH15,000 deposit (also redeemable but wow that’s high!)

Usually once you’re seated at a restaurant you expect the servers to come by with a menu yes? Wrong. Here the waiters just stand around watching… while confused patrons try to figure out that they have to stand up yet again and walk towards the notice board style menu that is posted up beside the bar. And because we don’t want to lose our table, not everyone can go and look at said menu. After you’ve decided on the very limited and pricey options available, you then have to walk a few steps to the bar and make your order there and pay there before getting your food. Given how packed the place was you can imagine how long the line to order food & drinks was my goodness

I opted for the pork belly (KSH2000) which does NOT come with fries… Fries are sold separately at KSH500. None of the mains come with fries. They do however come with a fresh salad mix, some feta cheese, hummus, steamed lentils and a chapo (supposedly a wrap)… basically chapo ndengu na kanyama lol

After ordering, you have to wait about 15min give or take and still no waiter will be watching for your order to bring it to you. It seems very much all self service so not sure what the staff are there for. The bartenders and chefs are the main people working there. Once you feel like you’ve waited for enough time, you have to stand up AGAIN… head to the grilling section and give out your meal receipt so someone can check if your food is ready.

Are you already tired of this ordering process because I was truly done. That’s way too much effort just to get a plate of food at a restaurant. That being said - I enjoyed my friend's beef more than the pork belly I got. The beef had a lot more flavour. The chapo was fresh and soft and the salad is a great addition to the meal, adding a nice freshness to the whole dish.

The ambiance here is chill and vibey if you can forget the number of people and if you have a good spot to sit at. The music is a relaxed Afro house, that plus the energy of your people around you plus the magical sunset as your backdrop… makes for a good time (when it’s not packed). I expected the place to be bigger for some reason but it’s quite a small shack, and with its popularity, it seems it’s a place that will always be full especially during high season and on weekends.

The service needs some work, the wait staff should at least try and assist surely. The ordering process needs to be worked on and streamlined because having people line up like we’re in a school cafeteria is not the way to do it. People keep saying ‘omg you have to come here for the sunset, the vibes, the sunset’ but I feel like it’s quite overrated. To go through all of that and spend way too much money just to catch the same sunset I can catch anywhere along that Watamu coastline (for much less hassle lol)… si lazima. It’s truly not a must.

The food is okay, not worth the hassle, the service lordddd… the ambience is what they have going for them and even that… reserve ONE net for 15k? It’s okay. It’s a place you experience once just to say you have, or to at least have your picture taken on the net for the watus and then never have to go back again. At least for me that was my experience.
