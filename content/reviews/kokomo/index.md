Kokomo is a Lebanese-Mediterranean beach bar and restaurant located right by where I was staying so this was the first place I tried in Watamu. I went there at night so I didn’t get a full view of what it looks like during the day but I like the day beds they have overlooking the ocean, perfect for chilling and sundowners and the booths in the restaurant were quite comfy.

They have a simple one pager menu which I appreciated. They focus on freshly grilled meats and fish plus lots of fresh salads. I was famished that day so I opted to just have a burger which I figured would be filling enough. I ordered the gourmet burger (KSH2400) which comes with fries and a side of coleslaw. I also got some passion juice (KSH450) which was extremely fresh, super tart just the way I like it

You’d think a burger is just that - a simple burger right? Wrong. This burger was the best burger I’ve had this year, hands down! It consisted of a mix of 3 prime beef cuts within one patty, topped off with melted cheddar cheese, caramelized onions, lettuce tomatoes the works… the brioche buns were perfectly toasted and basted with their unique house sauce and that coleslaw my goodness… That coleslaw was amazing.

I thought the price was a bit much for a burger and fries but the level of flavour this burger provided was very much worth the price. I barely touched the fries, I never added any ketchup (if you know me you know I add ketchup to almost everything lol) This burger needed nothing else. It was perfect all on its own.

When I was done I just sat there contemplating my life… like what else is there to do after you’ve inhaled such excellence??

The waiters were so great, because I was alone they consistently checked up on me, offered to help with anything and gave me some recommendations on what to do and where to go during my stay in Watamu. Such nice people, I really appreciated that.

The ambience here is nice and chill, perfect place to get a late lunch or dinner and just relax to the sounds of the ocean. Also a great place to catch the sunset from and with great service and great food, I don’t see how you can go wrong with choosing to come here.

I really wanted to go back later on during my stay and try other things from the menu but I did not get the chance but for sure next time I’m in Watamu, that’s gonna be my first stop.
