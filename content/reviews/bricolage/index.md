New York is a foodie’s haven and I love trying out so many new restaurants whenever I’m there. During my last visit I went to a couple and this was the first one I documented. I went to dinner here with my cousin who lives in Brooklyn and swears by this place so I had to try it.

Bricolage is a modern Vietnamese restaurant that has a casual vibe to it. It’s eclectic and vintage in style and has both indoor and outdoor seating and a back patio which I feel is the best place to sit because it’s hidden from the main streets so you get to avoid random stares and noise but you’re still dining under the stars, win win! I’ve never had Vietnamese food before so I made sure I hadn’t eaten anything beforehand to not ruin my appetite.

We had a few starters - chicken wings ($16), pork belly buns and slow-cooked lamb buns ($21) which was a bad idea because we got so full so quickly😅 (note to self, don’t starve yourself before going out to eat to avoid ordering too much food lol)

The chicken wings are called five spice crispy chicken wings and were very very tasty, I was expecting them to be spicy because of the name but these were just well seasoned fried chicken wings, the sauce though was very spicy so yay:)

These buns guys, the buns were amazing! Both have pickled veggies and fresh herbs and the difference between the two is that the pork is doused with hoisin sauce and the lamb has sriracha aioli. These buns were my favourite thing here - so yum, and super filling! I have to go back when I’m back in New York just to have some more.

You can’t be in a Vietnamese restaurant and not have Pho🍜 I’ve never had Pho but every time my friend Jayson talks about it (because he’s obsessed with it) I crave some so I was excited to finally try some! What I did not remember though is that American servings are bigger than your average and the bowl of Pho ($26) brought to us was quite overwhelming given that we were already stuffed😮‍💨 We did taste a bit though, and I really liked the broth mixed in with shredded chicken, veggies and rice noodles. It’s very flavourful and a filling dish that warms you up with every spoonful, perfect for a cold day/night.

So Pho reminds me more of ramen than the Chinese silk noodles, I think moreso because of the broth consistency. Which do I like better? Ramen still wins in my books🙈

In terms of cost, this restaurant is more on the higher end for NY standards, but also the majority of restaurants here are ranging between these prices so I don’t wanna know what super fancy places look cost wise because this was quite steep. It was worth every coin though.
