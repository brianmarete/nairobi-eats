Small Heaven bakery sent me one of their medley boxes and being the sweet tooth that I am, I was very excited to eat cake all day everyday 😁 What I thought would just be a box of small sample sizes ended up being a big box of 8 healthy slices of cake! The flavours included Passion Fruit, Pina Colada, Sacher, Lemon Blueberry, Cinnamon & Cherry, Chocolate Mint, Fruit Delight and Lemon Poppy.

These slices were so much, my friends and I were really eating cake everyday for like four days straight lol. I’ll review each slice individually below:

**_Passion fruit_**: This was surprisingly not as super sweet as I thought it would be, it’s perfectly balanced and the frosting isn’t too buttery which I love 👌🏾

**_Pina colada_**: I’m really not a fan of coconut… so I avoided the side with coconut shavings but the cake itself was super fluffy and moist! The frosting feels like it was whipped to the heavens, so good. There was a nice balance of the pineapples within the cake though I generally wouldn’t have pineapple in cake in my honest opinion. This cake surprised me as it’s a flavour I wouldn’t generally gravitate to but maybe for this one, I just might.

**_Sacher cake_**: I had no clue what sacher cake was until I looked it up. The Sacher cake is a very famous chocolate cake originating from Austria, it’s dense and spongy and usually has apricot jam filling and a chocolate glaze on top. I expected something super rich, it wasn’t and I’m glad - I can’t handle rich chocolate cakes anymore so this was pleasant to bite into. The frosting - once again - so smooth, so creamy, a yummy chocolatey flavour 🍫🤎 A clear trend so far is a fluffy, moist, non-clampy cake 😊 So far this was one of my favourite ones.

**_Lemon & Blueberry_**: Expected a lemony taste but there wasn’t even a hint of lemon but the blueberry was very strong and I loved the presence of actual blueberries. The cake itself was moist but not as fluffy as the others. The frosting was smooth, not too sweet and tasted quite delightful.

**_Cinnamon & Cherry_**: Surprisingly enjoyed this even though I really don’t like anything flavoured cherry. I ate the parts without the cherries and enjoyed the nice subtle taste of cinnamon in this super moist cake 😋 Frosting again - also a winner!

**_Chocolate mint_**: Loved this one! I may be biased because I love anything mint flavoured but this was really well balanced, the frosting doesn’t taste like toothpaste, it has a good mix of mint and sweet and the chocolate cake isn’t too dense - really great combo.

**_Fruity delight_**: This was my least favourite 😬 I generally don’t like fruit cake and this isn’t your typical fruit cake but still… it did nothing for me. The addition of fruits (apples, cherries, oranges) made me like it even less.

**_Lemon poppy_**: The lemon poppy flavour is a fan favourite even for me, (Java’s lemon poppy muffins have me in a chokehold 😮‍💨) so I knew I’d like it straight away. The frosting was as smooth as ever - I wanna know how she makes this frosting! I love the tiny crunch of the poppy seeds in every bite and the cake itself is moist, fluffy, even after being in the fridge for over three days. I would have liked the cake to have more of a lemon tang to it, just a tad but lemon is also quite a strong flavour to balance out so maybe that’s why it wasn’t in a larger quantity - all in all, a really good cake.

Here are my ratings - on a scale of 1 - 10, 1 being the least and 10 being the highest…

**Sacher cake: 10<br>
Chocolate Mint: 10<br>
Cinnamon & Cherry (minus the cherries): 8<br>
Lemon Poppy: 7.5<br>
Passion fruit: 7.5<br>
Cinnamon & Cherry (with the cherries): 6<br>
Pinacolada: 5<br>
Lemon Blueberry: 4<br>
Fruit delight: 2.5 (.5 is for the fluffiness of the cake)**<br>

Overall I enjoyed trying out so many different types of cakes and the medley box is a genius way of selling your different products. I may not eat cake again for possibly a couple of months (don’t hold me to this) because I’m so caked out but I’d for sure get the medley box again with other flavours next time. The fun is in tasting something different every time 😊

The owner, Natasha, has a brilliant business on her hands with this bakery. I really want to know how she maintains this consistency in all the cakes, such amazing consistency and moistness even after days of refrigeration 👌🏾

The medley box usually goes for KSH3,200 and is only available once a month so follow their [Instagram page](https://www.instagram.com/smallheavencakes/) to get notified when that will be as those boxes sell out quick! You can also order a slice or two or whole cakes of a flavour of your choice. The bakery is delivery only so not a place you can visit to have cake and tea but hopefully in future they will expand to dine-in.
