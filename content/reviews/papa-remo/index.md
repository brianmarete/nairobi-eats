I love a good beach side restaurant and Papa Remo is just that with all the vibes to match It’s spacious with lovely coastal decor, comfortable lounge areas and a great central bar. The ocean breeze welcomes you as you walk in and head towards the tables on the beach (best seats in the house imho). The views my goodness!

I came here for a solo dinner and I was very ready to stuff my face. The menu is a typical Italian menu, you have your pastas, your grilled meats, pizzas etc. The prices are a bit on the higher side so just be wary of that. They gave me a complimentary bread basket so I didn’t feel a need to get a starter (also budget) - I really ate a lot of bread. I love a bread basket but I also hate it because I can’t resist and then it ends up limiting my appetite after.

I ordered the ham and mushroom tagliatelle (KSH1900) and tiramisu for dessert (KSH950). That pasta was a thing of beauty Carefully tossed in the most delicious cream, fresh Parmesan sprinkled on top and I added some green chillies for that kick of spice I love. Tagliatelle is my favourite type of pasta and ham & mushroom is my favourite pasta combo so this dish was truly made just for me. I enjoyed every bite

The tiramisu was a small portion but still quite delicious, I actually carried some back to have for a night cap later:) I did come back here on a different day with friends and tried their pizza, the chicken pizza to be exact (KSH1600) and I like that their pizza has a super thin crust but didn’t enjoy the chicken pizza as much. It was quite lacking in flavour.

Their service was okay. The manager/owner (not sure who he was exactly) but he seemed to be more hands on than the actual staff… which is odd but still appreciated. The ambience here is 10/10! I love being by the ocean so already that was a plus. They also host quite a bash here on Saturday nights with DJ Jo Kisila in the decks, it’s probably the most popular night spot in Watamu

Papa Remo is great for lunches, dinners with family/friends. Perfect for sundowners, date nights and solo dates too

Reservations are required here especially during weekends and during high season periods.
