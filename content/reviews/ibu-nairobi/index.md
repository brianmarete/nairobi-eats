Late last year I got introduced to this vegan ice cream at a friend’s exhibition show and I loved it so much that Joshua (the proprietor) offered to send me a sample pack to try some of the other flavours he makes. Yes makes. He makes all this ice cream from scratch by himself!

The packaging already is quite vibrant, I love the little pop of colour on each label, really elevates the simple packaging.

Now for all my lactose intolerant people… you’ll be happy to know that this ice cream is DAIRY FREE meaning we won’t suffer while eating it My friend told me this after I’d already popped a lactaid pill but after I knew better… I did better and proceeded to have this sample pack guilt free with no bathroom runs.

The sample pack had 4 flavours: _Cajeta de nueva_, _Ukwaju caramel_, _Bastani Sonatti_, and _Chai Masala_. I tried these with a few friends and the ratings below reflect their thoughts too.

Rating them in order of what I liked best to least:

1. Cajeta de Nueva: it has a rich velvety texture, smooth serve, and it has bits of toffee/fudge flavour in it. It was so good This is luxury in an ice cream tub, so so delicious!
2. Chai Masala: hii chai ni CHAI wow! So so rich in flavour! It has little bits of ginger cookies added to it and that gives the flavour an extra kick. You can taste the chai masala, the mix of spices plus the ice cream base all coming together to form this perfect scoop of chai masala ice cream. I love this flavour.
3. Ukwaju Caramel: I love anything caramel and this flavour was really tasty! The ukwaju sauce is rich and perfectly tart, the caramel isn’t too rich so I couldn’t taste it as much, the main ice cream tasted more vanilla but not bad still, and it felt very well balanced infused with the ukwaju sauce.
4. Bastani Sonatti: this flavor has a pistachio base which I already knew would be my least favourite because I’m not the biggest fan of anything pistachio. The pink sauce - not sure what it was exactly, was quite distracting. So because I already don’t like pistachio this was too much for me, but for those who like pistachio it comes off quite light.

The Ibu Nairobi brand is such a fun one and one that is growing really well. You can order tubs of whatever flavour you’d like at KSH1500 a tub and it’ll be delivered to you. Makes for a great dessert especially given that it’s dairy free and vegan, lets more people enjoy the delightful flavours with no limitation.
