Tokyo is a Japanese restaurant located in the Lavington area. It’s such a nice spacious place with both indoor and outdoor seating surrounded by lush greenery. Came here for dinner on a weekday so it wasn’t super packed which is usually what I prefer. I found it odd that they had so many signs up about their last order times, like around each corner of the restaurant You can never say you didn’t know that they take their last orders at 9pm and close at 10pm lol.

The menu is quite wide with plenty of options to choose from. They have daily specials, they have a variety of sushi and sashimi options and they also have teppanyaki sets. For starters we had the tempura (KSH1900) and pork gyoza (KSH900) and for mains I had the sweet & sour prawns (KSH1950) with steamed rice while my friend had some Sashimi (KSH2150)

The pork gyoza (basically fried pork dumplings) weren’t that great, had very little pork in it and were quite over fried. The prawn tempura though was crispy perfection I love prawn tempura a lot and it’s usually easy to mess that up so I get very excited when I taste a well done tempura dish. The portion was also a good size for both of us, plenty of prawns to share.

I was skeptical about getting sweet & sour prawns, and wasn't sure about portions because restaurants tend to skimp on the amount of prawns in such dishes but this one was a good portion and very filling. Super tasty, sweet and sour anything is always yum and I just wanted something hearty that day so this plus some steamed rice really hit the spot. We did not have any dessert because we were way too full.

The service here was really good, the servers were very attentive and checked in often. I really loved the ambience here, Lavington has become such a hectic and congested area that being in there felt like a break from all the noise. Especially sitting outside under the dusk into night sky, light music playing alongside the murmurs of peoples conversations. It’s very nice and chill.

Tokyo feels like a great spot for those who love Japanese food and for those who wanna try out a different cuisine. Makes for a great date night spot, great for birthdays or other celebratory events as well as just a casual/business lunch/dinner meeting.

Or if you’re just looking for some sushi, I hear Tokyo is one of the better places to get it
