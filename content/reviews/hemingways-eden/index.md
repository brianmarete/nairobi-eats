Hemingways Eden is a boutique hotel located deep in the heart of Karen. Like really deep in Karen, if you don’t live in or near the Karen environs just put aside a good 40min to drive there. Once the roadtrip is done though, you are welcomed into a most serene space! The hotel’s restaurant, the Deck, is perfectly positioned next to a lagoon and borders the Giraffe Sanctuary forest, giving it such a picturesque view. You are surrounded by lush greenery all round, the sound of the water is so calming and rustic yet luxurious setup of the dining area really makes you feel like you’re not in the hustle and bustle of Nairobi anymore.

I’d like to say Hemingways Eden transports you to a peaceful and relaxing place, somewhere you can chill with loved ones or alone, somewhere you can dine on amazing food, bask in the sun or watch the sunset as you sit right by the lagoon. I love being anywhere where there’s a body of water, I love the calming energy water provides. The ambience here is top notch and the stunning artwork on display just added to the experience.

I came here for a team lunch so a special menu was curated for us with some items coming from their original menu. We had a variety of options so will just list what I tried here:

Starters: The Shamba Veggie platter (KSH1200), light cream of cauliflower soup (KSH700)
Mains: Seared beef medallion with rustic vegetables (KSH3500), Chicken Changezi
Dessert: Crepes Suzette

The veggies platter was nice and colourful but it needed some more flavour to it. The hummus was quite bland but the pita bread was fresh and soft at least. The cauliflower soup though was delicious, exuding lots of flavour

For the mains - the chicken curry was a nice sizable portion and very tasty too! The beef medallion was excellent! The potatoes were nice and crispy on the outside, soft on the inside, the beef was tender and rich in flavour - I got it well done of course and ate every bite!

The dessert wasn’t good at all - the crepes were drowned in this orange reduction sauce that was way too sweet for me and being the sweet tooth that I am, if I’m saying it’s too sweet then you know it was truly too sweet. I wouldn't recommend that dish.

The service here was really great, being part of a hotel I think it comes part and parcel, if the service was bad I’d hate to think how the service in the actual hotel would be. You can easily spend an entire day here if you’re not careful, it’s easy to get lost in the ease of the space. So many cozy spots to chill in after eating, they have a fully stocked bar right there too. It’s a perfect spot for a date, whether it's during the day or for date night. You can reserve the entire space for celebratory events like birthdays, bridal showers, team lunches/dinners etc. I don’t know how kid friendly it is given the water being so accessible but I would hope that they have a life guard on duty somewhere just in case.

It’s definitely on the higher side price wise so don’t come here on a whim, plan your wallet beforehand. What I would love for them to start (if at all they don’t have it yet) is a brunch menu for the weekends. This place is a perfect location for a Sunday brunch or Saturday too, a nice midday brunch that eases into afternoon drinks and sundowners and some light tapas dishes in the evening. Just an idea Hemingway’s, and if you do make this a thing, invite me please, would love to experience it
