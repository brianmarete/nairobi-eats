This is one of my favourite Japanese restaurants because they have the best Ramen. I only eat two things when I’m here - The Pork Ramen and the pork dumplings. A hot bowl of ramen is so perfect for the cold seasons and even the warmer seasons too.

They have a variety of different Ramen like veggie, chicken, spicy chicken, tofu etc. Same with the dumplings - fish, pork, chicken or tofu. The Ramen goes for KSH1250/ & dumplings KSH750/ for six pieces.

They also have sushi, and bento boxes plus many other options on their menu - I just usually only go there for Ramen and I highly recommend it!
