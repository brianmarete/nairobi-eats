Nabo Bistro is a place I don’t visit often but only because I’m not usually on that side of town often. If I was… I’d really be a regular. Tucked in a nice little corner of Lavington, Nabo Bistro is a restaurant that isn’t particular to a type of cuisine - they have everything from burgers, pasta, tacos, steak, sandwiches and breakfast too.

I came here for dinner with a very lovely friend and was surprised to find the place quite empty - it was probably a Wednesday evening. So already it looks like weekdays are a good day to go, not packed at all. Nabo is set up as an open space eatery with very simple decor and lots of space for events. So in as much as it doesn’t have much going for it aesthetically - it gives you the freedom to make it what you want for whatever event you’d like.

The menu has changed over time, before they used to have a particular burger that I loved so much, I’m still bummed they got rid of it. I can’t recall the name but it had a slice of pear in it and a divine chilli sauce that had me always going back for more! They now have a variety of burgers and I knew exactly which one I wanted because one thing about [Mr Jayson Mbogo](https://www.instagram.com/jaytakeapic/) - a dear friend and fellow foodie who raves about Nabo… he will make sure you know about the Nabo Bistro blue cheese burger 😅

We had fish tacos (KSH950) to start with - Nabo has some of the best Fish tacos in Nairobi. I love that they have a sprinkling of pomegranate seeds around the dish, adding a nice touch of sweetness to the tacos. The fish is perfectly crispy, it’s not caked in batter and the chipotle mayo + salsa combo makes for a very tasty taco 😋 This meal is very filling on its own already, just add some fries and you’ll be good to go.

Now for the mains - I’m not the biggest fan of blue cheese… I find it super sharp so I can’t have too much of it. Therefore, I was wary about trying the blue cheese burger (KSH1,600)… but I also really wanted to try it. So the waitress was kind enough to have the blue cheese come on the side so I can add the amount I’d like on the burger myself.

This burger guys… THIS BURGER was so good 😍 In addition to the blue cheese, it has onion jam and bacon and who doesn’t love bacon on a burger?? Whomst??? I tasted the blue cheese on its own to see if I could handle the taste… it wasn’t as sharp as I expected, which is good… I immediately slathered some on the burger. The patty was perfect. Flavours on 💯 That paired with onion jam (perfect choice as a spread btw), blue cheese and bacon and a well toasted bun… honestly… I want that burger right now 🥹 Jay you were not lying sir… this burger is a top choice.

The burger can be accompanied with fries or a salad. Of course I had fries - nothing bad to report here. We had zero room for dessert after eating all that food so I may have to go back to try that part of their menu - the passion cheesecake (KSH900) sounded very inviting.

The service was good, with the place not being too full, we didn’t really have a problem with service or any wait times. I can’t speak on how the service is when it’s full but on this day - it was great and I like that the waitress was willing to accommodate my blue cheese hangup.

Ambience - very chill, music isn’t crazy loud, it makes for a good working spot during the day too. It’s not set up to be a fancy restaurant so don’t come here expecting all the fireworks but it still has an intimate vibe to it that makes it great for dates or hangouts with friends be it breakfast, lunch or dinner.

I hope one of you will go try this whole meal (fish tacos as well) soon & tell me all about it 🥹
