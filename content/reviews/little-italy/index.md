I’ve been eating so much Pasta from Little Italy in the past two years so this review may sound all over the place but just know it’s all because I love majority of their dishes. Little Italy is yet another brainchild from Ando Foods. My favourite item from their menu is the Tagliatelle Mushroom pasta which is quite a big portion for one person. I always add grilled chicken to my order and some garlic bread which is insanely good!

The Pasta is perfect for a cold night indoors, creamy, flavourful, the right amount of mushrooms and chicken, so so good. I’d have added extra Parmesan just because I’m a cheese lover and if I die I die but at least I’d have suffered for all the right reasons.

I have also tried some more of their pasta options i.e their Fusilli Pesto, Spaghetti Bolognese, Penne Arrabiata & Penne Alfredo. The Fusilli Pesto - it was a bit too much for me, their Pesto sauce is super rich, so for the super pesto lovers this would be perfect for you, for me it was just too strong a taste, I couldn’t finish it.

The Spaghetti Bolognese - so so good! It’s very flavourful. That mince meat was clearly made with love and tossed with the best of herbs and spices because it tasted amazing! My one critique would be that it needed more sauce for a bolognese. It came off a tad dry, but still yummy though!

The Penne Arrabiata - people have really raved about this one, which is why I decided to finally try it. It's pasta with a tomato base, lots of chilli & spices, topped off with Parmesan. This one was too tomato-y for me. I liked it but it wouldn't be my first choice.

The Penne Alfredo - THIS. This is the winner guys. It’s creamy, cheesy, full of flavour & did I say creamy?? My stomach didn’t settle for hours after that but it was worth the struggle. So good!

I also always get the Tiramisu (which is halal i.e. no coffee liqueur in it), it’s such a good sweet treat to complete a perfect meal. My only qualm is that the portion feels so small, I wish it was bigger.

I finally got to try their lasagne recently - Mother’s Lasagne and let me tell y’all something… this lasagne was definitely made by someone’s mother and she put in work! It’s SO good. So filling, so rich, so yum! I would have liked a bit more creaminess/cheesiness within the layers but even as it is, it’s still so delicious:) The portion size is also perfect, in fact it’s probably even in excess because I couldn’t finish it in one sitting. I ate half and left the other for lunch for the next day. It goes for KSH850/ and I would definitely recommend getting some garlic bread too to go with your pasta.
