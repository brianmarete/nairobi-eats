First of all, this place is so massive! It feels like a mall that has just one restaurant and it gets crazy packed - so make reservations beforehand if you can. They have an expansive menu filled with traditional Indian dishes, Indian bbq and oriental dishes as well.

We had bhajiaz, chicken tikka, some butter naan and garlic naan, and we also tried butter chicken, palak paneer & cheesecake for dessert.

I’ve had my fair share of Indian food over the years & this unfortunately wasn’t AMAZING. It was flavourful, yes, but a lot of the dishes lacked the pop of spice you always get with Indian cuisine… or maybe I just like spicy food, who knows, but in every dish I kept asking why isn’t it spicy enough?

The portions are wonderful, great portions with good prices too. The cheesecake was really good even with the Indian sweetness added to it.

Their pineapple mint juice was a hit! I liked the ambiance of the place, it’s well lit, and secure. Service was questionable… and I’ve heard other complaints about how they treat non-Indians there… they may need to check that.

In conclusion I’m not the biggest fan & still don’t get the hype but may go back just to try the oriental side of their menu, but don’t think I’ll be heading back for the Indian side again.
