I’ve never actually visited this place but I’ve ordered from them plenty of times. If you’re looking for a place with simple yet great burgers, this is it.

They have a super popular combo called the fat boy combo that goes for KSH1,300 - it’s a double beef/chicken with all the works, lettuce, caramelised onions, cheddar cheese and this super yummy Turkish burger sauce that they have in all their burgers. AND it’s BOGOF.

I usually get the classic bacon and cheese burger (KSH750) and a side of their classique fries (KSH220) because I always forget that they usually add fries to the burger orders so I end up with a mad amount of fries but who’s complaining about extra potatoes.. not me😁

The burger is very simple as burgers go, nothing fancy but the taste?? That’s where the secret lies. The patty is perfectly seasoned, perfectly grilled and a nice size as well. That topped with some bacon and cheese and that sauce…so good!

The fries are really good too, nice and fresh, a light crisp on the outside and seasoned so you barely need to salt them. I’ve tried the masala fries once but they weren’t good… just meh.

I haven’t tried anything else here like their chicken burger or wings but I’m just glad in the plenty of times I’ve craved a burger, they’ve come through and satisfied that craving. They’re available on all delivery apps and I think they deliver to most areas within the city.
