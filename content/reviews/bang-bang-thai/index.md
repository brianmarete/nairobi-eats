Bang Bang Thai is a stunning restaurant located at the village market - new wing (do we still call that side new?). It’s gives off a very welcoming aura right from the entrance that’s adorned with so much foliage you feel like you’re entering an enchanted forest ☺️

The decor feels very eclectic and alternative compared to what you’d think a Thai restaurant would typically look like. They have expansive seating in their main area and cozy booths and isolated rooms further in that provide more privacy for groups that don’t wanna people watch while dining. I’m an avid people watcher but I also really liked the very cute room they put us in for my bookclub meetup so I didn’t make a change.

The menu had so much to choose from, I wanted everything! But my wallet said calm down sis! The prices here are definitely on the higher side so be wary of that upon coming here. Since we were a group of more than two we ordered a couple things so we could each try something different and we could all try each other’s food too.

Starters: Spicy Chicken dumplings (KSH1250), Moo Yang (pork belly, KSH1850), Satay chicken skewers (KSH300 per skewer), Hang Gai (crispy fried chicken, KSH1150). Mains: Chicken Pad Thai (KSH1750), Thai green curry (KSH2050) Thai red curry (KSH2050), Drinks: hibiscus lemonade (KSH650)

The chicken dumplings come as a portion of six. I can eat dumplings all day everyday, I love how versatile a dish they are and the day I can figure out how to make my own? It’s over for all of y’all 😅 These dumplings were definitely as spicy as stated on the menu (they put 🌶️🌶️🌶️ …). Usually I’m good with spicy food, I think I just underestimated the THREE CHILLI PEPPERS on the menu thinking I can manage lol… very spicy but very tasty still.

The Moo Yang i.e pork belly was for me the MVP of starters… chargrilled fleshy pieces of pork belly, well seasoned, nice and crispy on the outside and accompanied by Nam Jim Jaew sauce, a traditional Thai sauce made to have with grilled meats. Exquisite and full of flavour! We ordered another portion because of how good that pork was.

The chicken skewers may look very basic compared to everything else we had but they really packed a punch in flavour. That chicken was clearly well marinated and when you dip the skewer in some peanut sauce… a wonderful explosion of divine taste bursts in your mouth.

The Hang Gai (deep fried chicken - also now I know the Thai word for chicken is Gai.. ngai 😅), this dish can scare you into thinking it’s ULTRA spicy because of the super red crispy coating but it surprisingly wasn’t that bad. Definitely not the level of heat that the dumplings had lol… It's a manageable spice level and also very tasty. Asians really know how to make a good fried chicken, be it Thai, Korean, Chinese or Japanese… I hear the secret is double frying the chicken.

The chicken pad thai was my dish and after all those starters I was already full at the sight of the main dish that was put in front of me. Pad Thai is a popular Thai stir-fry noodle dish featuring rice noodles, chicken, scrambled eggs and a mix of traditional veggies tossed in a sweet and savoury sauce giving it a nice balanced taste of both sweet & salty. If you don’t like any type of sweetness in your food then you may not like any type of pad thai but me and my sweet tooth (that is very well taken care of by my wonderful dentist) we’ll pick a sweet & savoury dish any day. The portion of this dish was too much for me to finish in one sitting but I had a few bites to get a feel of the taste when it’s fresh and it was perfect. Actually much better than most pad thai’s I’ve tried in this city.

Now let’s talk curries. The green curry is a more popular choice for most people I think because it's lighter. It’s not too heavy on the spice but still filled with a lot of flavour and heavier on the coconut milk so it has a bit of sweetness to it compared to the red. The red curry is made with red chillies thus more spice but also doesn’t have the hint of sweetness like the green, it has more of an earthy savoury taste.

Of the two I loved the red curry more because Bang Bang’s version has a nice kick of spice that hits the back of your throat as an after-taste after each bite and that was a nice surprise.

After all this food - we definitely did not have ANY room for dessert. I can talk about the very refreshing drink I had though - the hibiscus lemonade. I love anything that has hibiscus and this lemonade was no exception - it was crisp, refreshing and had just the right amount of hibiscus tang to it.

I had very little expectations of this place because I never heard anyone say much about it which is odd because this is probably the closest to proper authentic Thai food I’ve had without being in actual Thailand! The service was great but our waiter I think was serving too many tables at once so he wasn’t as on top of his delivery but given we weren’t too pressed on time… I can’t say he was horrible.

Bang Bang is a wonderful place for those Sunday family lunches/dinners, great for special events like birthdays, office dinners etc. It’s also a great place for date nights - you get to explore a different cuisine and have a beautiful ambience to match. It pretty much works for everything and I personally cannot wait to go back and have all those dishes again!
