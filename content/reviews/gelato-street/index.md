I came across this sweet find late last year and I’ve been obsessed ever since!

Tucked away in the far corner of the rooftop garden of Sarit centre, gelato street is an ice cream parlour after my own heart. They make artisan gelato that is fresh, flavourful and just addictive. They have an array of flavours with some that change on a weekly basis like passion sorbet and others that will always be there like cookies and cream.

My current fave flavours so far are the cappuccino crunch, the white coffee and the raspberry sorbet😋 I always get two scoops of any of the three and the servers there are always so kind enough to add a big piece of crunchie chocolate on top😉

I have also tried the Kilimanjaro vanilla bean - for a vanilla flavour, it’s super rich and so yum! I’m not a vanilla girl (don’t kill me) but that vanilla, I’m willing to have over and over again!

A scoop is KSH300 and premium flavours like almond, piemonte hazelnut, or gianduja go for KSH400. If you’d like it in a waffle cone or waffle basket it’s KSH350 & KSH450 respectively.

I tend to prefer gelato over ice cream because gelato is less creamy and more dense so in as much as my body will still fight the milk aspect, at least it doesn’t have to fight both milk AND cream😮‍💨 I always have my lactase pills on deck whenever I’m in Sarit centre nowadays because I can’t go there and not venture up to the food court for a quick serving of gelato street’s fantastic gelato🍦

With this fantastic weather we’ve been having I know they’ve probably been busy all day everyday, and luckily they close at 10pm so you can have gelato as late as you want😊 Treat the kids this weekend or take yourself or you and yours for a little Valentine’s treat, mtaenjoy for sure:)
