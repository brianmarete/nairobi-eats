This new bombshell in the restaurant scene has been turning heads with every pic posted and every reel shared. Mythos is located at Mwanzi Market, Westlands and lemme just say… I haven’t seen a restaurant that aesthetically pleasing in quite some time.

Now I have never been to Greece (but soon come IJN) but I’ve seen a lot of pictures of Greece and their interior designer hit the nail on the head with the whole Grecian concept. The place is stunning for lack of a better word and really feels like you’ve been transported to a seaside restaurant off the coast of Crete. I could go on and on but this isn’t a review on interior spaces so let me stop.

I came here for lunch on a sunny Saturday with my friend and I made sure to make reservations beforehand because the place gets very busy especially on weekends. We sat outside on the terrace overlooking the busy westy streets. I appreciate that the menu isn’t bulky, it’s just one large sheet of paper with every food and drink item printed on both sides, very efficient and sustainable. There was so much to choose from but I had already been warned about their large portions so had to remember to choose wisely so as not to end up overeating.

For starters, we got Tyropita (KSH1100) which are feta phyllo fritters that come with a tahini dip. Phyllo is a particular type of dough and the use of this dough adds a nice crisp texture to the feta filled fritters. I enjoyed this dish and could easily eat more of those fritters because of how tasty they were! The tahini dip though was a bit of a miss for me because it had such a strong nutty taste that I feel didn’t compliment the feta too well.

We then decided to try a salad because you can’t be at a Greek restaurant and not have a refreshing Greek salad. We got the Olympic salad (KSH2400) just because the description sounded so colourful and yum! It has green and red lettuce, mango, raspberries, blueberries, strawberries, figs, cashews, walnuts and a yogurt mango salsa. Doesn’t that just sound like an amazing salad?? It was truly the salad of my dreams, it was so good! It has a variety of flavours just bursting in your mouth with every bite and I love that it has so much fruit. The tartness of the feta adds a nice balance to the sweetness of the fruits and for this meal I welcomed the nuttiness of the cashews and walnuts for a nice crunch.

For the mains we got the roasted pork roll (KSH1850) and the veggie moussaka (KSH1250). The portions were quite large, especially the pork roll, on presentation alone it was quite overwhelming but I appreciate that their portions match their prices.

The pork roll is a nice juicy roll of roasted pork belly placed on top of a bed of seasoned fries and topped off with dill, onions & feta cheese. (For the lactose intolerant - be wary that many dishes here will have feta cheese so plan accordingly). The pork was moist and full of flavour, it has quite a bit of salt so don’t add salt to the dish and if you take a bite of this plus some of that Olympic salad… you’ll leave there a much happier person. I did not finish this meal so leftovers for Sunday lunch were banging!

The veggie moussaka is quite a heavy dish. I would not recommend it for a sunny afternoon choice, I think it makes a much better dinner option especially in this cold season. It has a nice mix of zucchini and eggplant which actually tasted great, eggplant usually has a weird taste for me but this one was good

Gotta talk about the drinks because that hibiscus thyme lemonade (KSH500) is the most refreshing thing besides water this side of town I loved the touch of having actual hibiscus in the drink. The Tropikos (KSH600) was another fave, a gorgeous thick drink consisting of mango purée, passion pulp and pineapple mint - so good! The mint after-taste is so great for a mint lover like me.

You’d think after all this we wouldn’t bother with dessert right? But the manager was so kind to throw in a complimentary dessert of our choice, so how could we refuse? I got the Portokalopita (KSH950) which is basically a traditional Greek orange pie that’s served with some vanilla ice cream. The ice cream tasted very fresh, like it hasn’t been in the freezer for months lol and the addition of pistachio added a nice crunch. The pie itself tasted like bread pudding with hints of orange flavour - it was an interesting taste to me so not something I’d order again but glad I tried it.

The service here was great, we had a wonderful server named Tindi who took care of our every need, was super attentive and gave good recommendations. Mythos is definitely worth the hype and a most enjoyable dining experience be it day or night. It is quite up there in cost so plan accordingly when you do decide to visit. Perfect place for dates, friend hangouts and business meetings all at once - love a multi-faceted establishment
