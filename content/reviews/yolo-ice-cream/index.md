Located in the CBD, along Aga Khan walk, this place is fairly new. I went on a Saturday afternoon which was not the best idea. It was filled with ALL the Gen Zs plus so many kids… Nothing against them but wow it was so full of the youths. There was a line outside the door guys… I didn’t want to come back again another day but my friend wasn’t willing to wait - so we left. We came back again early on Sunday, around 11, Lactaid in hand (IYKYK…).

The place is cute, very Instagram vibes which is probably what they were going for. So much colour, nice seating and the menu is just as colourful. They have a very large menu, which has an array of milkshakes, yoghurt shakes, and a lot of different ice cream creations.

I had the Therapy ice cream (KSH590/) & my friend had the Minty (KSH530/). Therapy has scoops of vanilla Ice cream with doses of caramel sauce and chocolate chip cookies. The Minty is chocolate and blueberry ice cream, with wafers and mint. The therapy was just okay.

The Minty was BAD. I expected more… especially in terms of taste. The vanilla ice cream was just vanilla ice cream - if it’s being made in house, it’s not giving freshly made to be honest but it was okay. The Caramel sauce and cookies were also just there.

Maybe I wanted the cookies blended into the ice cream or something more than just placed on the side. The Minty was NOT minty at all. Also I hate chocolate ice-cream generally. But it was meant to be a blend of chocolate & blueberry and there was very little blueberry. See those tu leaves on top of it layers of ice cream… that was the mint. Were we meant to eat the leaf and feel the mint?? So odd.

They also only have like five flavours, I think vanilla, strawberry, chocolate, blueberry, and mango... I thought for an elaborate ice cream parlour they should have a lot more choice in flavours but they seem to be more about excess toppings and large servings.

Overall this wasn’t the ice cream parlour I thought it would be… so definitely not going back.
