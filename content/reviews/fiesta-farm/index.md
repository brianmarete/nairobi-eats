Fiesta Farm is located in the heart of Hardy, Karen. It’s quite a drive so prepare yourself accordingly in terms of time. The restaurant is set up on a vast compound which I assume also has the farm it’s named after. Loved the large amount of green space that people can use to chill in the sun, kids to play in… perfect for a sunny Sunday out.

Unfortunately we were there in the middle of June so it was the opposite of sunny - more like freezing, but because they know how to make their customers happy, there are plenty of Maasai blankets for you and your group to use to keep warm.

They have a nice concise menu with a little bit of everything. I immediately had a coffee because I needed warmth and we got some corn ribs (KSH800) and cheese samosas (KSH550) as starters. The corn ribs were good but not to the level as those at [Beit è Selam]({{<relref "/beit-e-selam" >}}). Also - it feels like everyone is adding corn ribs nowadays as a menu item and I love it👌🏾 It brings in more variety outside of wings and samosas. And by the way, the cheese samosas here were not great at all.

For mains we got lamb chops (KSH1900), grilled chicken with mushroom sauce and mashed potatoes (KSH2000), and the double beef burger (KSH1450). The chicken was just okay - nothing to write home about… as for my lamb chops, I really enjoyed them. It was a nice big portion and the lamb was so soft, juicy and grilled to perfection.

For dessert, of course I had to try the sticky toffee pudding and compare it to the GOAT one at [Sierra]({{< relref "/sierra-brasserie">}}) and it did not disappoint! I’d place it at #2 of all the sticky toffee puddings I’ve tried. It was really good, it had a well balanced sauce - not annoyingly sweet, the pudding was nice, warm and moist, and the ice cream on top was a nice touch. After tasting mine the rest of the table went ahead to order the exact same thing for dessert.

The service here was a bit wanting but not too horrible.

Fiesta farm is great for big and small groups, especially for event type lunches/dinners thanks to the big compound they have. I love that there’s space for kids to run around so this place would be great for weekend family lunches. I can definitely see myself coming back here.
