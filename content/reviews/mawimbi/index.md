Let me first talk about the service - I love that the hostess who greeted me at the door was so nice and gave me different options to choose from to sit despite having reserved a table for my party of two already. The place is really beautiful, gives off all the right vibes, especially at night, by the pool, they have a great band who played well and once seated we were tended to by the nicest waiter named Museti. Where my experience started to falter though…

First of all - those prices?? Why? I know the economy is bad but WOW that place is expensive. I ordered the Salmon Thai & Veg (KSH2400/) with fries. My friend had the glazed drumsticks (KSH2100/) which doesn’t come with anything (odd for a main) so he had to order a side separately.

The food was underwhelming to be honest. The salmon was quite a small piece and very overcooked… where were the veggies I was promised? The two big pieces of onion and tomato under the salmon were it? The drumsticks were apparently wrapped in bacon. I think they were in the oven too long because the chicken was dry and quite tough to eat. For such hefty prices I was expecting better portion sizes.

Since I was not full I decided to try dessert. The dessert menu has a beautiful image of the chocolate fondant cake surrounded by lots of berries, and a scoop of ice cream. I told Museti I’d like exactly that. As you can tell from the picture - the berries are countable, the cake itself was tiny, I think the only thing that was accurate was the ice cream scoop. This dish was KSH1400/

I told Museti my concerns and he was nice enough to bring me more berries, bless him. The band had eventually stopped playing so the music was blasting through the speakers and we could barely hear ourselves talk, ni fine dining ama ni club surely?

Yeah… Mawimbi is not worth the hype in my opinion. You’re just paying for vibes. If you’re going to price things so high then serve proper portions to justify that cost is what I feel also can the food actually taste good as well?

I’m not a seafood person so I didn’t try the sushi etc. Maybe that’s better than these dishes but I wouldn’t know. I won’t be going back to try anything else though.
