A rooftop cinema, cafe AND bar, Unseen was a fantastic find and it’s become a place I visit often when I need a change of work scenery:)

I had a nice little date here with my bestie and we really enjoyed the food there. We had pork bao buns, kimchi grilled cheese sandwiches, potato croquettes & Korean fried chicken (my fave!). I loved the Korean chicken and the bao buns the best, they were so flavourful, so filling! The kimchi sandwich was a bit too salty for both of us

The service was great, love the ambience & rooftop vibes it gives, it’s a really nice place to work from especially when the sun is out, also perfect for dates or events. They have a cosy cinema that can sit up to 80 people & it’s pink! They show a variety of films every other weekend & you can reserve the cinema for your own private screening at a decent cost. I’ve used the cinema for my own screening and gone to see a couple of cool films there too.
