I wanna highlight a brand I’ve really come to love - Ando Foods and particularly - Khan’s Biryani. I’ve had the sindhi chicken,mutton, & chicken masala biryani and I really enjoyed them all. Their packaging also is one of the best food package design I’ve seen in a while.

I also LOVE the fact that when you buy a meal they also make another of the same order to give to an under-privileged child.

The biryani is quite spicy (even the mild versions) for those who can’t handle anything spicy - for me personally I love their spice levels. The portions, my goodness - so much food! A single portion goes for KSH890/ & a double ranges from KSH1500-1780/
