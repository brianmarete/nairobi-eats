Hey there!

My name is Diana and I'm a self-obsessed food lover. I'm also a writer who spends her time working diligently from 9-5 but deep down all I want to do is eat... and I particularly always want to eat good food. The culinary world is a wonderful place that takes you on a journey of sights, sounds, smells and of course tastes. What's my taste you may ask? _Delicious. Delectable. Delightful_. Three words that demonstrate what I look for in the food served, the service given and the ambience provided when I visit any food establishment.

Through this blog, I'm excited to share my thoughts and experiences exploring the food world one restaurant at a time, one city at a time. I hope these reviews bring you one step closer to choosing the perfect date spot, that cool brunch spot and the best happy hour in town... Thank you so much for visiting, reading and sharing.

Happy Eating!
